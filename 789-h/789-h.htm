vi</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> this little book runs the
road of life, the common road of men, the white highway that
Hilarius watched from the monastery gate and Brother Ambrose saw
nearing its end in the Jerusalem of his heart.</p>
<p>The book is a romance.&nbsp; It may be read as a romance of
the Black Death and a monk with an artist&rsquo;s eyes; but for
the author it is a romance of the Image of God.&nbsp; While the
Divine Face is being unveiled for Hilarius in the masque that
shocks and bewilders him, and the secret of sorrow and sin, of
death and life and love, is told by his speechless and dying
&ldquo;little maid,&rdquo; we, if we choose, may hear again the
Road mender&rsquo;s epilogue to the story of the man of this
earth, the man of the common highway:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;Dust
and ashes and a house of devils,&rsquo; he cries; and there comes
back for answer, &lsquo;<i>Rex concupiscet decorem
tuum</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BLIND EYES IN THE FOREST</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarius</span> stood at the Monastery
gate, looking away down the smooth, well-kept road to the highway
beyond.&nbsp; It lay quiet and serene in the June sunshine, the
white way to the outer world, and not even a dust cloud on the
horizon promised the approach of the train of sumpter mules laden
with meats for the bellies and cloth for the backs of the good
Brethren within.&nbsp; The Cellarer lacked wine, the drug stores
in the farmery were running low; last, but not least, the
Precentor had bespoken precious <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>colours, rich gold, costly vellum, and
on these the thoughts of Hilarius tarried with anxious
expectation.</p>
<p>On his left lay the forest, home of his longing
imaginings.&nbsp; The Monastery wall crept up one side of it, and
over the top the great trees peered and beckoned with their
tossing, feathery branches.&nbsp; Twice had Hilarius walked
there, attending the Prior as he paced slowly and silently along
the mossy ways, under the strong, springing pines; and the
occasions were stored in his memory with the glories of St
Benedict&rsquo;s Day and Our Lady&rsquo;s Festivals.&nbsp; Away
to the right, within the great enclosure, stretched the Monastery
lands, fair to the eye, with orchard and fruitful field, teeming
with glad, unhurried labour.</p>
<p>At a little elevation, overlooking the whole domain, rose the
Priory buildings, topped by the Church, crown and heart of the
place, signing the sign of the Cross over the daily life and work
of the Brethren, itself the centre of that life, the object of
that work, ever unfinished because love <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>knows not how to make an end.&nbsp; To
the monks it was a page in the history of the life of the Order,
written in stone, blazoned with beauty of the world&rsquo;s
treasure; a page on which each generation might spell out a word,
perchance add a line, to the greater glory of God and St
Benedict.&nbsp; They were always at work on it, stretching out
eager hands for the rare stuffs and precious stones devout men
brought from overseas, finding a place for the best of every
ordered craft; their shame an uncouth line or graceless arch,
their glory each completed pinnacle and fretted spire; ever
restoring, enlarging, repairing, spendthrift of money and time in
the service of the House of the Lord.</p>
<p>The sun shone hot on grey wall and green garth; the spirit of
insistent peace brooded over the place.&nbsp; The wheeling white
pigeons circling the cloister walls cried peace; the sculptured
saints in their niches over the west door gave the blessing of
peace; an old, blind monk crossed the garth with the hesitating
gait of habit lately acquired&mdash;on his face was great
peace.&nbsp; It rested everywhere, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>this peace of prayerful service, where
the clang of the blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer smote the sound of the
Office bell.</p>
<p>Hilarius, at the gate, questioned the road again and again for
sign of the belated train.&nbsp; It was vexatious; the
Prior&rsquo;s lips would take a thinner line, for the mules were
already some days overdue; and it was ill to keep the Prior
waiting.&nbsp; The soft June wind swept the fragrance of
Mary&rsquo;s lilies across to the lad; he turned his dreamy, blue
eyes from the highway to the forest.&nbsp; The scent of the
pinewoods rushed to meet his sudden thought.&nbsp; Should he,
dare he, break cloister, and taste the wondrous delight of an
unwalled world?&nbsp; It were a sin, a grave sin, in a newly-made
novice, cloister-bred.&nbsp; The sweet, pungent smell overpowered
him; the trees beckoned with their long arms and slender fingers;
the voice of the forest called, and Hilarius, answering, walked
swiftly away, with bowed head and beating heart, between the
sunburnt pine-boles.</p>
<p>At last he ventured to stop and look <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>around him, his fair hair aflame in
the sunlight, his eyes full of awe of this arched and pillared
city of mystery and wonder.</p>
<p>It was very silent.&nbsp; Here and there a coney peeped out
and fled, and a woodpecker toiled with sharp, effective
stroke.&nbsp; Hilarius&rsquo; eyes shone as he lifted his head
and caught sight of the sunlit blue between the great,
green-fringed branches: it was as if Our Lady trailed her
gracious robe across the tree-tops.&nbsp; Then, as he bathed his
thirsty soul in the great sea of light and shade, cool depths and
shifting colours, the sense of his wrong-doing slipped from him,
and joy replaced it&mdash;joy so great that his heart ached with
it.&nbsp; He went on his way, singing <i>Lauda Syon</i>, his eyes
following the pine-boles, and presently, coming out into an open
glade, halted in amazement.</p>
<p>A flower incarnate stood before him; stood&mdash;nay, danced
in the wind.&nbsp; Over the sunny sward two little scarlet-clad
feet chased each other in rhythmic maze; dainty little brown
hands spread the folds of the deep blue skirt; a bodice,
silver-laced, <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>served as stalk, on which balanced, lightly swaying, the
flower of flowers itself.&nbsp; Hilarius&rsquo; eyes travelled
upwards and rested there.&nbsp; Cheeks like a sunburnt peach,
lips, a scarlet bow; shimmering, tender, laughing grey eyes
curtained by long curling lashes; soft tendrils of curly hair,
blue black in the shadows, hiding the low level brow.&nbsp; A
sight for gods, but not for monks; above all, not for untutored
novices such as Hilarius.</p>
<p>His sin had found him out; it was the Devil, the lovely lady
of St Benedict; he drew breath and crossed himself hastily with a
murmured &ldquo;<i>Apage Sataas</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dancer stopped, conscious perhaps of a chill in the
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O what a pretty boy!&rdquo; she cried gaily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Playing truant, I dare wager.&nbsp; Come and
dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius crimsoned with shame and horror.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, and his voice trembled somewhat,
&ldquo;art thou not shamed to deck thyself in this devil&rsquo;s
guise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dancer bit her lip and stamped her little red shoe
angrily.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>&ldquo;No
more devil&rsquo;s guise than thine own,&rdquo; she retorted,
eyeing his semi-monastic garb with scant favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can
a poor maid not practise her steps in the heart of a forest, but
a cloister-bred youngster must cry devil&rsquo;s
guise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke her anger vanished like a summer cloud, and she
broke into peal on peal of joyous laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor
lad, with thy talk of devils; hast thou never looked a maid in
the eyes before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrewdly hit, mistress; never before has Hilarius looked a
maid in the eyes, and now he drops his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou not know it is sin to deck the body thus, and
entice men&rsquo;s souls to their undoing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An what is the matter with my poor body, may it please
you, kind sir?&rdquo; she asked demurely, and stood with downcast
eyes, like a scolded child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wrong to deck the body,&rdquo; began Hilarius,
softening at her attitude, &ldquo;because,
because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the merry laugh rang out.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Because, because&mdash;nay, Father&rdquo; (with a
mock reverence), &ldquo;methinks thy sermon is not ready; let it
simmer awhile, and <i>I</i> will catechise.&nbsp; How old art
thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; She held up her small finger
admonishingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen,&rdquo; replied Hilarius, surprised into
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou a monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, a novice only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou ever loved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius threw up his hands in shocked indignation, but she
went on unconcerned&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a foolish question; the answer&rsquo;s writ
large for any maid to read.&nbsp; But tell me, why art thou angry
at the thought of love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius felt the ground slipping from under his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an evil love, and a holy love; it is good to
love God and the Saints and the Brethren&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the sisters?&rdquo; the wicked little laugh
pealed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor sisters!&nbsp; Why, boy, the world
is full of love, and not all for <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the Saints and the Brethren, and it
is good&mdash;good&mdash;good!&rdquo;&nbsp; She opened her arms
wide.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the devil and the monks who call it
evil.&nbsp; Hast thou never seen the birds mate in the
springtime, nor heard the nightingale sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well for a husband to love his wife, and a mother
her child.&nbsp; That is love in measure, but not so high as the
love we bear to God and the Saints!&rdquo; quoth Hilarius
sententiously, mindful of yesterday&rsquo;s homily in the
Frater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can&rsquo;st thou know that thou lovest the
Saints?&rdquo; the dancer persisted.</p>
<p>How did he know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dost thou know that thou lovest thy mother?&rdquo;
he cried triumphantly, forgetting the reprobate nature of the
catechist, and anxious only to come well out of the wordy
war.</p>
<p>But the unexpected happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou dare speak to me of my mother?&nbsp;
<i>I</i>, love her?&mdash;I <i>hate</i> her;&rdquo; and she flung
herself down on the grass in a passion of weeping.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Even a
master of theology is helpless before a woman&rsquo;s tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maid, maid,&rdquo; said Hilarius, in deep distress,
&ldquo;indeed I did not mean to vex thee;&rdquo; and he came up
and laid his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>So successfully can the Prince of Darkness simulate grief!</p>
<p>The dancer sat up and brushed away her tears; she looked
fairer and more flowerlike than before, sitting on the green
sward, looking up at him through shining lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, boy, &rsquo;tis naught.&nbsp; How could&rsquo;st
thou know?&nbsp; But what of thine own mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, what is this?&nbsp; And thy father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a gentle knight who died in battle ere I knew
him.&nbsp; I came a little child to the Monastery, and know no
other place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;&mdash;vindictively,&mdash;&ldquo;then
<i>thy</i> mother may have been a light o&rsquo; love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light of love; it has a wondrous fair sound,&rdquo;
said Hilarius with a smile.</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>The
maid looked at him speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Go home</i>, <i>Boy</i>,&rdquo; she said at last
emphatically.</p>
<p>Just then a lad, a tumbler by his dress, pushed a way through
the undergrowth, and stood grinning at the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Gia!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must make
haste; the others wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my brother,&rdquo; said the dancer,
&ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the bag slung across the
youth&rsquo;s shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;I trust he hath a fine fat
hen from thy Monastery for our meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius broke into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The Convent&rsquo;s hens!&nbsp; The Saints preserve us!&nbsp;
Was nothing sacred, and were the Ten Commandments written solely
for use in the Monasteries?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis stealing,&rdquo; he said feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis stealing,&rdquo; the dancer mocked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hast thou another sermon ready, Sir Preacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty bellies make light fingers,&rdquo; quoth the
youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did&rsquo;st thou ever hunger,
master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the fast of Lent which presses
somewhat,&rdquo; said Hilarius.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;But ever a meal certain once in the day?&rdquo;
queried the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, surely, and collation also; and Sunday is no
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mischievous apes laughed&mdash;how they laughed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, good Preacher,&rdquo; said the dancer at last,
rising to her feet, &ldquo;thou dost know it is wrong to steal;
but hast never felt hunger.&nbsp; Thou dost know it is wrong to
love any but God, the Saints, and thy mother; but thou hast never
known a mother, nor felt what it was to love.&nbsp; Blind
eyes!&nbsp; Blind eyes! the very forest could teach thee these
things an thou would&rsquo;st learn.&nbsp; Farewell, good novice,
back to thy Saints and thy nursery; for me the wide wide world;
hunger and love&mdash;love&mdash;love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seized her brother&rsquo;s hand and together they danced
away like two bright butterflies among the trees.</p>
<p>Hilarius stared after them until they disappeared, and then
with dazed eyes and drooping head took his way back to the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Monastery.&nbsp; The train of mules had just arrived;
all was stir, bustle, and explanation; and in the thick of it he
slipped in unseen, unquestioned; but he was hardly conscious of
this mercy vouchsafed him, for in his heart reigned desolation
and doubt, and in his ears rang the dancer&rsquo;s parting cry,
&ldquo;Hunger and love&mdash;love&mdash;love!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LOVE OF PRIOR STEPHEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Brother Bernard</span>, the Precentor,
dealt out gold, paint and vellum with generous hand to his
favourite pupil, and wondered at his downcast look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks this gold is dull, Brother,&rdquo; said
Hilarius one day, fretfully, to his old master.</p>
<p>And again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very poor vermilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brother looked at him enquiry.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;Nay, nay, boy; &rsquo;tis thine eyes at fault;
naught ails the colours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, the Precentor came to look at the delicate border
Hilarius was setting to the page of the Nativity of Our Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now may God be good to us!&rdquo; he cried with
uplifted hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since when did man paint the Blessed
Mother with grey eyes and black hair&mdash;curly too, i&rsquo;
faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius crimsoned, he was weary of limning ever with blue and
gold, he faltered.</p>
<p>It was the same in chapel.&nbsp; The insistent question
pursued him through chant and psalm.&nbsp; Did he really
<i>love</i> the Saints&mdash;St Benedict, St Scholastica, St
Bernard, St Hilary?&nbsp; The names left him untouched; but his
lips quivered as he thought of the great love between the holy
brother and sister of his Order.&nbsp; If he had had a sister
would they have loved like that?</p>
<p>The Saints&rsquo; Days came and went, and he scourged himself
with the repeated question, kneeling with burning cheeks, and
eyes from which tears were not <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>absent, in the Chapel of the Great
Mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Light of Love,&rdquo; the girl had called
his mother; what more beautiful name could he find for the Queen
of Saints herself?&nbsp; So he prayed in his
simplicity:&mdash;&ldquo;Great Light of Love, Mother of my
mother, grant love, love, love, to thy poor sinful
son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question came in his daily life.</p>
<p>Did he love the Prior?&nbsp; He feared him; and his voice was
for Hilarius as the voice of God Himself.&nbsp; Brother
John?&nbsp; He feared him too; Brother John&rsquo;s tongue was a
thing to fear.&nbsp; Brother Richard, old, half-blind?&nbsp;
Surely he loved Brother Richard?&mdash;sad, helpless, and lonely,
by reason of his infirmities&mdash;or was it only pity he felt
for him?</p>
<p>Nay, let be; he loved them all.&nbsp; The Monastery was his
home, the Prior his father, the monks his brethren; why heed the
wild words of the witch in the forest?&nbsp; And yet what was it
she had said?&nbsp; &ldquo;For me the wide world, hunger, and
love&mdash;love&mdash;love!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>He
wandered in the Monastery garden and was troubled by its
beauties.&nbsp; Two sulphur butterflies sported around the tall
white lilies at the farmery door.&nbsp; Did they love?</p>
<p>He watched the sparrows at their second nesting, full of
business and cheerful bickerings.&nbsp; Did they love?</p>
<p><i>She</i> had said the answer was writ large for him to see:
he wandered staring, wide-eyed but sightless.</p>
<p>At last in his sore distress he turned to the Prior, as the
ship-wrecked mariner turns to the sea-girt rock that towers
serene and unhurt above the devouring waves.</p>
<p>The Prior heard him patiently, with here and there a shrewd
question.&nbsp; When the halting tale was told he mused awhile,
his stern blue eyes grew tender, and a little smile troubled the
firm line of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;thou art in
the wrong school; nursery, was it the maid said?&nbsp; A shrewd
lass and welcome to the hen.&nbsp; Thou art a limner at
heart&mdash;Brother Bernard tells of thy wondrous <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>skill with
the brush&mdash;and to be limner thou must learn to hunger and to
love as the maid said.&nbsp; Ay, boy, and to be monk too, though
alack, men gainsay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Hilarius, waxing bold from
excessive need, &ldquo;did&rsquo;st thou ever love as the maid
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, boy&mdash;thy mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence.&nbsp; Then the boy said
timidly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid said she might be light of love; &rsquo;tis a
beautiful thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior started, and looked at him curiously:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What didst thou tell the maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I never knew her, but that my father was a gentle
knight who died ere I saw him; and then the maid said perchance
my mother was light of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said the Prior gravely, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a
weary tale, and sad of telling.&nbsp; Thy mother was wondrous
fair without, but she reckoned love lightly, nay, knew it not for
the holy thing it is, but thought only of bodily lusts.&nbsp;
Pray for her soul&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>his voice grew stern&mdash;&ldquo;as
for one of those upon whom God, in His great pity, may have
mercy.&nbsp; Thus have I prayed these many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius looked at him in wide-eyed horror:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was evil, wicked, my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay&mdash;a light woman, that was what the maid
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then great darkness fell upon the soul of Hilarius, and he
clasped the Prior&rsquo;s knees weeping and praying like a little
child.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so, my son,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;for a
time thou shalt go out into the world, to strive and fail, hunger
and love; only have a care that thou art chaste in heart and
life; for it is the pure shall see God, and seeing love
Him.&nbsp; Leave me now that.&nbsp; I may set in order thy going;
and send the Chamberlain hither to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Hilarius knelt through the long hours at the great
Rood, and then at St Mary Maudlin&rsquo;s altar he did penance
for his dead mother&rsquo;s sin.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>A week
later he left the Monastery as a bird leaves its nest, nay, is
pushed out by the far-seeing parent bird, full of vague terrors
of the great world without.&nbsp; He had a purse for his
immediate needs; a letter to a great knight, Sir John Maltravers,
who would be his patron; and another to the Prior&rsquo;s good
friend, the Abbat of St Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Convent bade him
a sad farewell, for they loved this gentle lad who had been with
them from a little child; and Brother Richard strained his filmy
eyes to look his last at the young face he would never see
again.</p>
<p>The Prior gave him the Communion; and later walked beside him
to the gates.&nbsp; Then as Hilarius knelt he blessed him; and
the boy, overmastered by nameless fear, sprang up and prayed that
he might stay and learn some other way, however hard.&nbsp; The
Prior shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my son, so it must be; else how shall I answer to
the Master for this most precious lamb of my flock?&nbsp; Come
back to us&mdash;an thou can&rsquo;st&mdash;let no fear deter
thee; <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>only
take heed, when thine eyes are opened and the great gifts of
hunger and love are vouchsafed thee, to keep still the faithful
heart of a little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he bade him go; and Hilarius, for the pull of his
heart-strings, must needs run hot-foot down the broad forest road
and along the highway, without daring to look back, and so out
into the wide, wide world.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE KING&rsquo;S SONG-BIRD</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Martin the Minstrel</span> sat under a
wayside oak singing softly to himself as he tuned his
vielle.&nbsp; He was a long lanky fellow with straight black
locks flat against his sallow face, and dark eyes that smouldered
in hollow cavities.&nbsp; He wore the King&rsquo;s colours, and
broke a manchet of white bread with his mid-day repast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh-ho!&rdquo; sighed Martin, and laid the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>vielle
lovingly beside him, &ldquo;another four leagues to Westminster,
and I weary enough of shoe-leather already, and not another penny
piece in my pocket &rsquo;til I win back to good King Ned.&nbsp;
A brave holiday I have had, from Candlemas to Midsummer; free to
sing or to be silent, to smile or frown; wide England instead of
palace walls; a crust of bread and a jug of cider instead of a
king&rsquo;s banquet.&nbsp; Now but another few leagues and the
cage again.&nbsp; Money in my pocket, true; but a song here and a
song there, such as suit the fancy of the Court gentles, not of
Martin the Minstrel.&nbsp; Heigh-ho, heigh-ho! &rsquo;tis a poor
bird sings at the word of a king, and a poor enough song too, if
Edward did but know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes here?&nbsp; Faith, the lad goes a steady pace
and carries a light heart from his song; and no ill voice
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hilarius, and he sang the <i>Alma Redemptoris</i> as he
sped along the green grass which bordered the highway.</p>
<p>When Martin hailed him he turned aside <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>gladly, and
his face lit up at the sight of the vielle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence dost thou come, lad?&rdquo; said Martin, eyeing
him with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many days&rsquo; journey from the Monastery of Prior
Stephen,&rdquo; answered Hilarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thou art no monk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, a novice scarcely; but the Prior hath bidden me go
forth to see the world.&nbsp; It is wondrous fair,&rdquo; he
added sincerely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who speaks thus is cloister-bred,&rdquo; said
Martin, and as Hilarius made sign of assent, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
writ on thy face as well.&nbsp; Thy Prior gave thee letters to
the Abbat of St Peter&rsquo;s, I doubt not; thy face is set for
Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, for Westminster, but my letters are for that good
knight, Sir John Maltravers.&nbsp; I should have made an end of
my journeying ere now but that two days ago I met strange
company.&nbsp; They took my purse and hat and shoes, and kept me
with them all night until the late dawn.&nbsp; Then they gave me
my goods again, and bade me God-speed.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;But kept thy purse?&rdquo; Martin laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, it is here, and naught is missing.&nbsp; It was
all passing strange, and I feared them, for they looked evil men;
yet they did me no wrong, and set me on my way gently enough,
giving me provision, which I lacked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick-purses and cut-throats afraid of God&rsquo;s
judgments for once,&rdquo; muttered Martin; then aloud,
&ldquo;Well, young sir, we shall do well if we win Westminster
before night-fall; shall we journey together since our way is the
same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius assented gladly; and as they went, Martin told him of
Court and King, and the wondrous doings when the Princess Isabel
was wed.&nbsp; He listened open-eyed to tales of joust and revel
and sport; and heard eagerly all the minstrel could tell of Sir
John Maltravers himself, a man of great and good reputation, and
no mean musician; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; added Martin, &ldquo;three
fair daughters he hath, the eldest Eleanor, fairest of them all,
of whom men say she would fain be a nun.&nbsp; Thou art a pretty
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>lad, I
wager one or other will claim thee for page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will strive to serve well,&rdquo; said Hilarius
soberly, &ldquo;but I have never spoken but to one maid
&rsquo;til yesterday, when a woman gave me
good-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked at his companion queerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou art for Westminster!&nbsp; Nay, but by all the
Saints this Prior of thine is a strange master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but for a time,&rdquo; said Hilarius, &ldquo;then
I shall go back to the Monastery again.&nbsp; But first I would
learn to be a real limner; I have some small skill with the
brush,&rdquo; he added simply.</p>
<p>Martin stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the cloister?&nbsp; Nay, lad, best turn about
and get back now, not wait till thou hast had a taste of Court
life.&nbsp; Joust and banquet and revel, revel, banquet, and
joust, much merry-making and little reason, much love and few
marryings: a gay round, but not such as makes a monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that life will not be for me.&nbsp; I am <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>to serve my
lord, write for him, methinks.&nbsp; But tell me, good Martin,
dost thou love the Court?&nbsp; It seems a fine thing to be the
King&rsquo;s Minstrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lad, nay,&rdquo; said the other hastily,
&ldquo;give me the open country and the greenwood, and leave to
sing or be silent.&nbsp; Still, the King is a good master, and
lets me roam as I list if I will but come back; &rsquo;tis
ill-faring in winter, so back I go to pipe in my cage and follow
the Court until next Lady-day lets the sun in on us
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck his vielle lightly, and the two fell into a slower
pace as the minstrel sang.&nbsp; Hilarius&rsquo; eyes filled with
tears, for he was still heart-sore, and Martin&rsquo;s voice rose
and fell like the wind in the tossing tree-tops which had
beckoned him over the Monastery wall.&nbsp; The song itself was
sad&mdash;of a lover torn from his mistress and borne away
captive to alien service.&nbsp; When it was ended they took a
brisker pace in silence; then, after a while, Hilarius said
timidly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&rsquo;st thou sing of thyself, good
Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Ay, lad, and of my mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
stopped suddenly, louted low to the sky, and with comprehensive
gesture took in the countryside.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fair mistress,
lad, and a faithful one, though of many moods.&nbsp; A man suns
himself in the warmth of her caresses by day, and at night she is
cold, chaste, unattainable; at one time she is all smiles and
tears, then with boisterous gesture she bids one seek shelter
from her buffets.&nbsp; She gives all and yet nothing; she trails
the very traces of her hair across a man&rsquo;s face only to
elude him.&nbsp; She holds him fast, for she is mother of all his
children; yet he must seek as though he knew her not, or she
flouts him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius listened eagerly.&nbsp; Was this what the dancer had
meant&mdash;the &ldquo;wide wide world, hunger and
love&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&rsquo;st thou ever hunger, good Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad,&rdquo; said the minstrel, surprised,
&ldquo;and &rsquo;tis good sauce for the next meal&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&rsquo;st thou ever love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin broke into a great laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, marry I have more times than I <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>count
years.&nbsp; But see, here comes one who knows little enough of
hunger or love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Round the bend of the road came a
man in hermit&rsquo;s dress carrying a staff and a well-filled
wallet.&nbsp; His carriage seemed suddenly to become less
upright, and he leaned heavily on his stick as he besought an
alms from the two travellers.</p>
<p>Hilarius felt for his purse, but Martin stayed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lad, better have left thy money with the
pick-purses than help to fill the skin of this lazy rogue;
&rsquo;tis not the first time we have met.&nbsp; See here,&rdquo;
and with a dexterous jerk he caught the hermit&rsquo;s
wallet.</p>
<p>This one was too quick for him; with uplifted staff and a
mouthful of oaths, sorely at variance with his habit, he snatched
it back, flung the bag across his shoulder, and made off at a
round pace down the road, while Martin roared after him to wait
an alms laid on with a cudgel.</p>
<p>Hilarius gazed horrified from the retreating <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>figure to his
laughing companion, who answered the unspoken question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rascal, lad, yon carrion, and no holy father.&nbsp;
They are the pest of every country-side, these lazy rogues, who
never do a hand&rsquo;s turn and yet live better than many a
squire.&nbsp; I warrant he has good stuff in that larder of his
to make merry with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius walked on for some time in silence with bent
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear the world is an ill place and far from
godliness,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will look thus to one cloister-bred, and &rsquo;tis
true enough that godliness is far from most men; but if a
hermit&rsquo;s robe may cover a rascal, often enough a good heart
lies under an ill-favoured face and tongue.&nbsp; See,
lad,&rdquo; as another turn in the road brought them in sight of
Westminster, &ldquo;there lies thy new world, God keep thee in
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a grey-walled city rising from the water&rsquo;s
edge, with roof and pinnacle, gable and turret, aflame in the <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>light of the
western sky; in front flowed the river like a stream of molten
gold.</p>
<p>Hilarius gave a little cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like the New Jerusalem!&rdquo; he said, and
Martin smiled grimly.</p>
<p>An hour later they stood within the walls of Westminster city,
and Hilarius, amazed and weary, clung close to Martin&rsquo;s
side.&nbsp; Around him he saw russet-clad archers, grooms, men on
horseback, pedlars, pages, falconers, scullions with meats,
gallant knights, gaily dressed ladies; it was like a tangled
dream.&nbsp; The gabled fronts of the houses were richly blazoned
or hung with scarlet cloth; it was a shifting scene of colour,
life, and movement, and to Hilarius&rsquo; untutored eyes, wild
confusion.&nbsp; Outside the taverns clustered all sorts and
conditions of men, drinking, gossiping, singing, for the
day&rsquo;s work was done.&nbsp; In the courtyard of the
&ldquo;Black Boar&rdquo; a chained bear padded restlessly to and
fro, and Hilarius crossed himself anxiously&mdash;was the devil
about to beset him under all guises at once?&nbsp; He raised a
fervent <i>Ora </i><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span><i>pro me</i> to St Benedict as he hurried past.&nbsp; A
string of pack-horses in the narrow street sent folk flying for
refuge to the low dark doorways, and a buxom wench, seeing the
pretty lad, bussed him soundly.&nbsp; This was too much, only the
man in him stayed the indignant tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Martin,
Martin!&rdquo; he cried; but the minstrel was on his own ground
now, and was hailed everywhere with acclamations, and news given
and demanded in a breath.&nbsp; Hilarius, shrinking, aghast, his
ears scourged with rough oaths and rude jests, his eyes offended
by the easy manners round him, his cheek hot from the late
salute, took refuge under a low archway, and waited with anxious
heart until the minstrel should have done with the crowd.</p>
<p>Martin did not forget him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hol&agrave;, lad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;see how they
welcome the King&rsquo;s bird back to his cage!&nbsp; As for
thee, thou hast gone straight to thy cot like a homing pigeon;
through that archway, lad, lies thy journey&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, apprehending for the first time
Hilarius&rsquo; <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>white face and piteous eyes, Martin strode across, swept
him under the archway into a quiet courtyard where a fountain
rippled, and, having handed him over to Sir John&rsquo;s steward,
left him with a friendly slap on the back and the promise of
speedy meeting.</p>
<p>Hilarius delivered the Prior&rsquo;s letter, and followed the
steward into a rush-strewn hall where scullions and serving-men
were busy with preparations for the evening meal; and sat there,
lonely and dejected, his curiosity quenched, his heart sore, his
whole being crying out for the busied peace and silent
orderliness of his cloister home.&nbsp; The servants gibed at
him, but he was too weary to heed; indeed he hardly noticed when
the household swept in to supper, until a page-boy tweaked him
slyly by the ear and bade him come to table.&nbsp; He ate and
drank thankfully, too dazed to take note of the meal; and the
pages and squires among whom he sat left him alone, abashed at
his gentleness.&nbsp; At last, something restored by the
much-needed food, Hilarius looked round the hall.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>It
reminded him of the Refectory at home, save that it was far
loftier and heavily timbered.&nbsp; The twilight stealing in
through high lancet windows served but to emphasize the upper
gloom, which the morrow&rsquo;s sun would dissipate into
cunningly carved woodwork&mdash;a man&rsquo;s thought in every
quaintly wrought boss and panel, grotesque beast and guarding
saint.&nbsp; A raised table stood at the upper end of the hall,
and here gaily dressed pages waited on the master of the house
and his honoured guests.&nbsp; Hilarius rightly guessed the tall,
careworn man of distinguished presence to be no other than Sir
John himself, and he liked him well; but his eyes wandered
carelessly over the rest of the company until they were caught
and held by a woman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; It was Eleanor, the
fairest of the knight&rsquo;s three fair daughters; and when
Hilarius saw her he felt as a weary traveller feels who meets a
fellow citizen in a far-off land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even such a face must the Blessed Agnes have
had,&rdquo; he thought, his mind <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>reverting to his favourite Saint;
&ldquo;she is like the lilies in the garth at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange comparison, for the girl was extravagantly
dressed in costly materials and brilliant colours, her hair
coifed in the foolish French fashion of the day; and yet, despite
it all, she looked a nun.&nbsp; Her face was pale, her brows set
straight; her eyes, save when she was much moved, were like grey
shadows veiling an unknown soul; her mouth, delicately curved,
was scarcely reddened; her head drooped slightly on her long,
slender neck, a gesture instinct with gracious humility.&nbsp;
She was like a pictured saint: Hilarius&rsquo; gaze clung to her,
followed her as she left the hall, and saw her still as he sat
apart while the serving men cleared the lower tables and brought
in the sleeping gear for the night.&nbsp; He lay down with the
rest, and through the high, lancet windows the moonlight kissed
his white and weary face as it was wont to do on bright nights in
the cloister dormitory.&nbsp; Around him men lay sleeping soundly
after the day&rsquo;s toils; there was none to heed, and he
sobbed like <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>a little homesick child, until his tired youth
triumphed, and he fell asleep, to dream of Martin and the Prior,
the lady at the raised table, and the pale, sweet lilies in the
cloister garth.</p>

39</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CITY OF PURE GOLD</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Blind</span> eyes, blind
eyes!&rdquo; sang the dancer.</p>
<p>Hilarius woke with a start.&nbsp; He had fallen asleep on a
bench in the sunny courtyard and his dream had carried him back
to the forest.&nbsp; He sat rubbing his eyes and only half-awake,
the sun kissing his hair into a halo against the old grey
wall.&nbsp; A falcon near fretted restlessly on her perch, and a
hound asleep by the fountain rose, and, slowly stretching its
great limbs, came towards him.</p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock on a warm day in September; the
courtyard was deserted save for a few busied serving men, and the
knight and his household, were at a tilting in the Outer Bailey,
all but the <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Lady Eleanor, Hilarius&rsquo; mistress, for, as Martin
had foreseen, Sir John had so appointed it.</p>
<p>It was now two months since Hilarius had come to the city
which had seemed to him in the distance as the New Jerusalem full
of promise; but he had found no angels at the gates, nor were the
streets full of the righteous; nay, the place seemed nearer of
kin to the Babylon of Blessed John&rsquo;s Vision&mdash;with a
few holy ones who would surely be caught up ere judgment fell,
amongst them Sir John and Lady Eleanor.</p>
<p>A good knight and a God-fearing man was Sir John, tender to
his children, gentle with his people, a faithful servant to God
and King Edward; shrewd withal, and an apt reader of men.&nbsp;
Therefore, and because of the love he bore to Prior Stephen, he
set Hilarius to attend his eldest daughter, who seemed to belong
as little to this world as the lad himself; and felt that in so
doing he had achieved the best possible for his old friend,
according to his asking.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Hilarius for his part served the Lady Eleanor as an
acolyte tends the chapel of a saint, only she was further removed
from him than a saint, by reason of her pale humanity.&nbsp; He
soon perceived, as he watched her at banquet, tourney, or
pageant, that she went to a revel as to the Sacrament, and sat at
a mummers&rsquo; show with eyes fixed on the Unseen.&nbsp; She
moved through the gay vivid world of Court gallants and joyous
maidens like a shadow, and the rout grew graver at her
coming.</p>
<p>It was much the same with her lover, Guy de
Steyning&mdash;brother of that Hugh de Steyning men wot of as
Brother Ambrosius&mdash;a gentle knight with mild blue eyes, a
peaked red beard, and great fervour for heavenly things.&nbsp;
The pair liked one another well; but their time was taken up with
preparation for Paradise rather than with earthly business, and
their speech lent itself more readily to devout phrases than to
lovers&rsquo; vows.&nbsp; It was small wonder, therefore, that
another year saw them both <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>by glad consent in the cloister, he
at Oxford, and Eleanor in the Benedictine House of which her aunt
was Prioress.</p>
<p>Hilarius had written of his saintly mistress to Prior Stephen
just as he had written of the wondrous beauty of St Peter&rsquo;s
Abbey: &ldquo;With all its straight, slender, upstanding pillars,
methinks &rsquo;tis like the forest at home&rdquo; (forgetting
that his more intimate knowledge of the forest partook of the
nature of sin).&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lady Eleanor, my honoured
mistress,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is a most saintly and devout
maiden, full of heavenly lore, and caring nought for the things
of this world;&rdquo; and he added, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis beautiful
to see such devotion where for the most part are sinful and
light-minded persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior laid the script aside with a smile and a sigh; and
when Brother Bernard asked news of the lad, answered a little
sadly, &ldquo;Nay, Brother, he still sleeps;&rdquo; and indeed
there seemed no waking him to a world of men&mdash;living,
striving, sorely-tried men.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>He
dwelt in a land of his own making&mdash;a land of colour and
light and shadow in which much that he saw played a part; only
the gorgeous pageants turned to hosts of triumphant saints
heralded by angels; while the knights at a tourney in their brave
armour pictured St George, St Michael, or St Martin in his
dreams.</p>
<p>It was a limner he longed to be, far away from the stir and
stress, not a page attending a great lady to the Court
functions.&nbsp; He yearned ever after the Scriptorium, with its
busied monks and stores of colour and gold.&nbsp; It lay but a
stone&rsquo;s throw away behind the jealous Monastery walls, but
it was no part of Prior Stephen&rsquo;s plan that the lad should
go straight from one cloister to another.</p>
<p>To Hilarius sitting on the bench in the sun, came one of
Eleanor&rsquo;s tirewomen to bid him wait on her mistress.&nbsp;
He rose at once and followed her through the hall and up the
winding stair, along a gallery hung with wondrous story-telling
tapestry, to the <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>bower where Eleanor sat with two of her women busied
with their needle.</p>
<p>Hilarius found his mistress, her hands idle on her knee.&nbsp;
He louted low, and she bade him bring a stool and sit beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am weary,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;this life is
weariness.&nbsp; Tell me of the Monastery and the
forest&mdash;stay, tell me rather of the New Jerusalem that
Brother Ambrose saw and limned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius, nothing loth, settled himself at her feet, elbow on
knee, and chin on his open hands, his dreamy blue eyes gazing
away out of the window at the cloud-flecked sky above the Abbey
pinnacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Brother Ambrose,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;was ever a
saintly man, approved of God and beloved by the Brethren; ay, and
a crafty limner, save that of late his eyesight failed him.&nbsp;
To him one night, as he lay a-bed in the dormitory, came the word
of the Lord, saying: &ldquo;Come, and I will show thee the Bride,
the Lamb&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Brother Ambrose arose and
was carried to a great and high mountain, even as in the Vision
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of Blessed
John.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a still night of many stars, and Brother
Ambrose, looking up, saw a radiant path in the heavens; and lo!
the stars gathered themselves together on either side until they
stood as walls of light, and the four winds lapped him about as
in a mantle and bore him towards the wondrous gleaming
roadway.&nbsp; Then between the stars came the Holy City with
roof and pinnacle aflame, and walls aglow with such colours as no
earthly limner dreams of, and much gold.&nbsp; Brother Ambrose
beheld the Gates of Pearl, and by every gate an angel, with wings
of snow and fire, and a face no man dare look on, because of its
exceeding radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then as Brother Ambrose stretched out his arms because
of his great longing, a little grey cloud came out of the north
and hung between the walls of light, so that he no longer beheld
the Vision, but heard only a sound as of a great multitude
crying, &lsquo;Alleluia&rsquo;; and suddenly the winds came about
him again, and lo! he found himself in bed in the dormitory, and
it was <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>midnight, for the bell was ringing to Matins; and he
rose and went down with the rest; but when the Brethren left the
choir, Brother Ambrose stayed fast in his place, hearing and
seeing nothing because of the Vision of God; and at Lauds they
found him and told the Prior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He questioned Brother Ambrose of the matter, and when
he heard the Vision, bade him limn the Holy City even as he had
seen it; and the Precentor gave him uterine vellum and much fine
gold and what colours he asked for the work.&nbsp; Then Brother
Ambrose limned a wondrous fair city of gold with turrets and
spires; and he inlaid blue for the sapphire, and green for the
emerald, and vermilion where the city seemed aflame with the
glory of God; but the angels he could not limn, nor could he set
the rest of the colours as he saw them, nor the wall of stars on
either hand; and Brother Ambrose fell sick because of the
exceeding great longing he had to limn the Holy City, and was
very sad; but our Prior bade him thank God and <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>remember the
infirmity of the flesh, which, like the little grey cloud, veiled
Jerusalem to his sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence.&nbsp; Lady Eleanor clasped her shadowy
blue-veined hands under her chin, and in her eyes too was a great
longing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemeth to me small wonder that Brother Ambrose fell
sick,&rdquo; she said, at length.</p>
<p>Hilarius nodded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had ever a patient, wistful look as of one from
home; and often he would sit musing in the cloister and scarce
give heed to the Office bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks, Hilarius, it will be passing sweet to dwell
in that Holy City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lady,&rdquo; said her page tenderly, &ldquo;surely
thou hast had a vision even as Brother Ambrose, for thine eyes
wait always, like unto his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eleanor shook her head, and two tears crept slowly from the
shadow of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, not to such as I am is the vision <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>vouchsafed;
though my desire is great, &rsquo;tis ever clogged by sin; and
for this same reason I would get me to a cloister where I might
fast and pray unhindered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius looked at her with great compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet lady, the Lord fulfil all thy desires; yet,
methinks, thou art already as one of His saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but a poor sinner in an evil world,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing to me, Hilarius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he sang her the <i>Salve Regina</i>, and when it was ended
she bade him go, for she would fain spend some time in prayer
upon her primer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Lady and all Saints be with thee, sweet
mistress!&rdquo; he said, and left her to sob out once more the
sins and sorrows of her tender childlike heart.</p>

49</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CITY THAT HILARIUS SAW</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarius</span> went back to the
courtyard, his soul full of trouble.&nbsp; He leant against the
fountain, playing with the cool water which fell with monotonous
rhythm into the shallow timeworn basin.&nbsp; The cloudless sky
smiled back at him from the broken mirror into which he gazed,
and the glory of its untroubled blue thrilled him
strangely.&nbsp; He too had a vision which he longed to limn; but
it was of earth, not Heaven, like that vouchsafed to Brother
Ambrose; and yet none the less precious, for was it not the
Monastery at home which so haunted him, the grey, familiar walls
with their girdle of sunlit pasture, and the mantling forest
which bowed and swayed at the will of the whispering wind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well seek Heaven&rsquo;s gate in yon fair reflection
as learn to love in this light-minded, deceitful city,&rdquo;
Hilarius said to <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>himself a little bitterly.&nbsp; He deemed that he had
plumbed its hollowness and learnt the full measure of its
vanity.&nbsp; Already he shunned the company and diversions of
his fellow pages, though he was ever ready to serve them.&nbsp; A
prentice lad&rsquo;s homely brawl set him shivering; a
woman&rsquo;s jest painted his cheeks &rsquo;til they rivalled a
young maid&rsquo;s at her first wooing.&nbsp; He plucked aside
his skirts and walked in judgment; only wherever mountebank or
juggler held the crowd enthralled, there Hilarius, half-ashamed,
would push his way, in the unacknowledged hope of seeing again
the maid whose mother, like his own, was light o&rsquo; love: a
strange link truly to bind Hilarius in his blindness to the rest
of poor sinful humanity.</p>
<p>Suddenly there broke on his musing the clatter of horse-hoofs,
and a gay young page came spurring with bent head under the low
archway.&nbsp; He reined up by Hilarius:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lad, kind lad, wilt thou do me a
service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will I, Hal, an it be in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Take this purse, then, to the Cock Tavern and
give it mine host.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Luke Langland&rsquo;s
reckoning; he left it with me yesternight, but my head was full
of feast and tourney, and &rsquo;tis yet undelivered.&nbsp; Mine
host will not let the serving men and the two horses go
&rsquo;til he hath seen Luke&rsquo;s money, and I cannot stay,
for my lord will need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius took the purse; and his fellow page, blessing him for
a good comrade, clattered back through the gateway.</p>
<p>The streets were full of life and colour; serving men in the
livery of Abbat and Knight, King and Cardinal, lounged at the
tavern doors dicing, gaming, and drinking.&nbsp; Hilarius walked
delicately and strove to shut eyes and ears to the sights and
sounds of sin.&nbsp; He delivered the purse, only to hear mine
host curse roundly because it was lighter than the reckoning; and
after being hustled and jeered at for a milk-faced varlet by the
men who stood drinking, he sought with scarlet cheeks for a less
frequented way.</p>
<p>The quiet of a narrow street invited him; he turned aside, and
suddenly traffic and <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>turmoil died away.&nbsp; He was in a
city within a city; a place of mean tenements, wretched hovels,
ruined houses, and, keeping guard over them all, a grim square
tower, blind save for two windowed eyes.&nbsp; Men, ill-favoured,
hang-dog, or care-worn, stood about the house doors silent and
moody; a white-faced woman crossing the street with a bucket gave
no greeting; the very children rolling in the foul gutters
neither laughed nor chattered nor played.&nbsp; The city without
seemed very far from this dismal sordid place.</p>
<p>Hilarius felt a touch on his shoulder, and a kindly voice
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, young sir, for what crime dost thou take
sanctuary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up and saw an old man in the black dress of an
ecclesiastic, the keys of St Peter broidered on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanctuary,&rdquo; stammered Hilarius, &ldquo;nay, good
sir, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wert thou star-gazing, then, that thou could&rsquo;st
stray into these precincts and <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>know it not?&nbsp; This is the City
of Refuge to which a man may flee when he has robbed or murdered
his fellow, or been guilty of treason, seditious talk, or
slander&mdash;a strange place in which to see such a face as
thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did but seek a quiet way home and lost the
turning,&rdquo; said Hilarius; &ldquo;in sooth, &rsquo;tis a
fearful place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, boy, &rsquo;tis a place of darkness and despair,
despite its safety&mdash;even the King&rsquo;s arm falls short
when a man is in these precincts: but from himself and the
knowledge of his crime, a man cannot flee; hence I say &rsquo;tis
a place of darkness and despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unspoken question shone in Hilarius&rsquo; eyes, and the
other answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, there is no blood on my soul, young sir.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas good advice I gave, well meant but ill received, so
here I dwell to learn the wisdom of fools and the foolishness of
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the Abbat know what evil men these are that seek
the shelter of Holy Church?&rdquo; asked Hilarius, perplexed.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;Most surely he knows; but what would&rsquo;st
thou have?&nbsp; It hath ever been the part of the Church to
embrace sinners with open arms lest they repent.&nbsp; A man
leaves wrath behind him when he flees hither; but should he set
foot in the city without, he is the law&rsquo;s, and no man may
gainsay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir, but these look far from repentance,&rdquo;
said Hilarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, true eno&rsquo;,&rdquo; rejoined the other
cheerfully, &ldquo;but then &rsquo;tis not for nothing Mother
Church holds the keys.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s law may fail to reach,
but there is ever hell-fire for the unrepented sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius nodded, and his eyes wandered over the squalid place
with the North Porch of the Abbey for its sole beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be as hell here, to live with robbers and men
with bloody hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the old man hastily, &ldquo;many of
them are kindly folk, and many have slain in anger without
thought.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a sad place, though, and thy young face
is like a sunbeam on a winter&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; Come, I will
show thee thy road.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>He led
Hilarius through the winding alleys and set him once more on the
edge of the city&rsquo;s stir and hum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can no further,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Farewell, young sir, and God keep thee!&nbsp; An old
man&rsquo;s blessing ne&rsquo;er harmed any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius gave him godden, and sped swiftly back through the
streets crowded with folks returning from the tourney.&nbsp; The
Abbey bell rang out above the shouts and din.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an evil, evil world,&rdquo; quoth young
Hilarius.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A SENDING FROM THE LORD</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">October</span> and November came and sped,
and Hilarius&rsquo; longing to be a limner waxed with the waning
year.&nbsp; One day by the waterside he met Martin, of whom he
saw <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>now
much, now little, for the Minstrel followed the Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cage grows too small for me, lad,&rdquo; he said,
as he stood with Hilarius watching the sun sink below the Surrey
uplands; &ldquo;ay, and I love one woman, which is ill for a man
of my trade.&nbsp; I must be away to my mistress, winter or no
winter, else my song will die and my heart break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis even so with me, good Martin,&rdquo; said
Hilarius sadly; &ldquo;I too would fain go forth and serve my
mistress; but the cage door is barred, and I may not open it from
within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin whistled and smote the lad friendly on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, lad, patience, thou art young yet.&nbsp;
Eighteen this Martinmas, say you?&nbsp; In truth &rsquo;tis a
great age, but still leaves time and to spare.&nbsp;
&lsquo;<i>All things come to a waiting man</i>,&rsquo; saith the
proverb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later he chanced on Hilarius sitting on a bench under
the south wall of the farmery cloister.&nbsp; It was a mild, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>melancholy
day, and suited the Minstrel&rsquo;s mood.</p>
<p>He sat down by him and told of King and Court; then when
Hilarius had once more cried his longing, he said
gravely:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One comes who will open more cage doors than thine and
mine, lad&mdash;and yet earn no welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius looked at him questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lad, hast thou ever seen Death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, good Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes, lad, it comes; or I am greatly at
fault.&nbsp; I saw the Plague once in Flanders, and fled against
the wind, and so came out with a clean skin; now I am like to see
it again; for it has landed in the south, and creeps this
way.&nbsp; Mark my words, lad, thou wilt know Death ere the
winter is out, and such as God keep thee from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius understood little of these words but the sound of
them, and turned to speak of other things.</p>
<p>Martin looked at him gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best get back to the cloister and Prior Stephen,
lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Nay, good Martin, that may not be; but I have
still a letter for the Abbat of St Alban&rsquo;s, and would
hasten thither if Sir John would set me free.&nbsp; Methinks I am
a slow scholar,&rdquo; went on poor Hilarius ruefully, &ldquo;for
I have not yet gone hungry&mdash;and as for love, methinks there
are few folk to love in this wicked city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin laughed and then grew grave again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he comes who will teach thee both, and yet I
would fain find thee a kinder master.&nbsp; Well, well, lad, get
thee to St Alban&rsquo;s an it be possible; thou art best in a
cloister, methinks, for all thy wise Prior Stephen may
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he went off singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three felons hung from a roadside tree,<br
/>
One black and one white and one grey;<br />
And the ravens plucked their eyes away<br />
From one and two and three,<br />
That honest men might see<br />
And thievish knaves should pay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest these might be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As blind as they.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, well-a-day, well-a-day!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&nbsp;
On the gallows-tree hung they.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Hilarius listened with a smile until the last notes of
Martin&rsquo;s voice had died away, and then fell a-musing of
hunger and love, the dancer and the Prior.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if his thought had taken speech, he heard a voice
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hunger, I hunger, feed me most sweet Manna, for I
hunger&mdash;I hunger, and I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, but there was no one in sight.&nbsp;
Again the shrill quavering voice called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love of God, I hunger, Love of God, I die.&nbsp;
Blessed Peter, pray for me!&nbsp; Blessed Michael, defend
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius knew now; it was the Ankret, that holy man who for
sixty years had fasted and prayed in his living tomb at the
corner of the cloister.&nbsp; He was held a saint above all the
ankrets before him, and wondrous wise; the King himself had
sought his counsel, and the Convent held him in high esteem.</p>
<p>Again the voice: Hilarius strove to reach up to the grated
window of the cell&mdash;it was too high above him.&nbsp; An
overpowering <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>desire came upon him to ask the Ankret of his
future.&nbsp; With a spring he caught at the window&rsquo;s
upright bars; his cap flew off and he hung bare-headed, the sun
behind him, gazing into the cell.</p>
<p>On his knees was an old man whose long white hair lay in
matted locks upon his shoulders, and whose beard fell far below
his girdle.&nbsp; The skin of his face was like grey parchment,
and his deep-set eyes glowed strangely in their hollow
cavities.</p>
<p>Hilarius strove to speak, but words failed him.</p>
<p>The Ankret looking up saw the beautiful face at his window
with its aureole of yellow hair, and stretched out his bony
withered hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Michael, Blessed Michael, the messenger of the
Lord!&rdquo; he cried, gaining strength from the vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would&rsquo;st thou, Father!&rdquo; said Hilarius,
afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, who am I that I should speak? and yet, and
yet&mdash;&rdquo; the old man&rsquo;s voice <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>grew
weaker&mdash;&ldquo;the Bread of Heaven, that I may die in
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched out his hands again entreatingly, and Hilarius
was sore perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou crave speech of the Abbat, my
Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ankret looked troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Michael, Blessed Michael!&rdquo; he murmured
entreatingly.</p>
<p>Hilarius&rsquo; hands hurt him sore; it was clear that the
holy man saw some wondrous vision, and &rsquo;twas no gain time
to speech of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Michael, Blessed Michael!&rdquo; quavered the
old, tired voice.</p>
<p>Hilarius felt himself slipping; with a great effort he held
fast and braced himself against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed Michael, Blessed Michael!&rdquo;&mdash;The
appeal in the half-dead face was awful.</p>
<p>Hilarius&rsquo; grip failed; he slid to the ground bruised and
sore from the unaccustomed strain, but well pleased.&nbsp; True,
he had gained no counsel from the Ankret, <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>but he had
seen the holy man&mdash;ay, even when he was visited by a
heavenly messenger, and that in itself should bring a
blessing.&nbsp; He turned to go, when a sudden thought came to
him.&nbsp; There was no one in sight, no sound but the failing
cry from the tired old saint.&nbsp; Hilarius doffed his cap again
and his fresh young voice rose clear and sweet through the thin
still air:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Iesu</i>, <i>dulcis memoria</i>,<br />
<i>Dans vera cordis gaudia</i>;<br />
<i>Sed super mel et omnia</i><br />
<i>Dulcis ejus praesentia</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the fourth stanza his memory failed him; but he could hear
the Ankret crooning to himself the words he had sung, and crying
softly like a little child.</p>
<p>Hilarius went home with wonder in his heart, but said no word
of what had befallen him; and that night the Ankret died, and the
Sub-Prior gave him the last sacraments.</p>
<p>Next day it was known that a vision had been vouchsafed the
holy man before <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>his end; and that the Prince of Angels himself had
brought his message of release: and Hilarius, greatly content to
think that the Blessed Michael had indeed been so near him, kept
his own counsel.</p>
<p>He told Lady Eleanor of Martin&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save the King!&rdquo; she said, and went into her
oratory to pray: and there was need of prayer, for the
Minstrel&rsquo;s foreboding was no idle one.&nbsp; Ere London
knew it the Plague was at her gates; yet the King, undeterred,
came to spend Christmas at Westminster; but Martin was not in his
train.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s mirth waxed hot by reason of the terror
they would not recognise.&nbsp; Banquet and revel, allegory and
miracle play; pageant of beautiful women and brave men;
junketing, ay, and rioting&mdash;thus they flung a defiance at
the enemy; and then fled: for across the clash of the feast bells
sounded the mournful note of funeral dirge and requiem.</p>
<p>Eleanor, knowing Hilarius&rsquo; ardent longing for school and
master, prayed her father to set him on the way to St
Alban&rsquo;s <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>instead of keeping him with them to follow a fugitive
Court.&nbsp; The good knight, feeling one page more or less
mattered little when Death was so ready to serve, and anxious for
the lad&rsquo;s safety and well-being, assented gladly
enough.&nbsp; So it came to pass that on the Feast of the Three
Kings Hilarius found himself on the Watling Street Way, a
well-filled purse in his pocket, but a fearful heart under his
jerkin; for the Death he had never seen loomed large, a great
king, and by all accounts a most mighty hunter.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BLIND EYES WHICH COULD SEE</span></h3>
<p>It is, for the most part, the moneyed man who flees from the
face of Death; the poor man awaits him quietly, with patient
indifference, in the field or under his own roof-tree; ay, and
often flings the door wide for the guest, or hastens his
coming.&nbsp; Thus <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>it came to pass that while the stricken poor agonised in
the grip of unknown horror, bishop and merchant, prince and
chapman, fine ladies in gorgeous litters, abbesses with their
train of nuns, and many more, fled north, east, and west, from
the pestilent cities, and encumbered the roads with much
traffic.&nbsp; One procession, and one only, did Hilarius meet
making its way to London.</p>
<p>It was a keen frosty day; there had been little previous rain
or snow, and the roads were dry; the trees in the hedgerows, bare
and stricken skeletons, stood out sharp and black against a cold
grey sky.&nbsp; Suddenly the sound of a mournful chant smote upon
the still air, music and words alike strange.&nbsp; The singers
came slowly up the roadway, men of foreign aspect walking with
bent heads, their dark, matted locks almost hiding their wild,
fixed eyes and thin, haggard faces.&nbsp; They were stripped to
the waist, their backs torn and bleeding, and carried each a
bloody scourge wherewith to strike his fellow.&nbsp; At the third
step they signed the sign of the Cross with their <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>prostrate
bodies on the ground; and thus in blood and penitence they went
towards London.</p>
<p>Hilarius was familiar with the exercise but not the manner of
it.&nbsp; These strange, wild men filled him with horror, and he
shrank back with the rest.&nbsp; Then a man sprang from among the
watching crowd, tore off jerkin and shirt, and flung up his arms
to heaven with a great sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left wife and children to perish alone,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;and fled to save my miserable skin.&nbsp; Now may
God have mercy on my soul, for I go back.&nbsp; Smite, and smite
hard, brother!&rdquo; and he stepped in front of the first
flagellant.</p>
<p>At this there arose a cry from the folk that looked on, and
many fell on their knees and confessed their sins, accusing
themselves with groanings and tears; but Hilarius, seized with
sudden terror, turned and fled blindly, without thought of
direction, his eyes wide, the blood drumming in his ears, a great
horror at his heels&mdash;a horror that could drive a man from
wife <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and
child, that had driven brave Martin to flee against the wind, and
all this folk to leave house and home to save that which most men
count dearer than either.</p>
<p>At last, exhausted and panting, he stayed to rest, and saw,
coming towards him, a blind friar.&nbsp; Hilarius had turned into
a by-way in the hurry of his terror, and they two were
alone.&nbsp; The friar was a small, mean-looking man, feeling his
way by the aid of hand and staff; his face upturned, craving the
light.&nbsp; He stopped when he came up with Hilarius, and turned
his sightless eyes on him; a fire burnt in the dead ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou that son of Christ waiting to guide my steps,
as the Lord promised me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius started back, afraid at the strange address; but the
friar laid one lean hand on his arm, and, letting the staff slip
back against his shoulder, felt Hilarius&rsquo; face, not with
the light and practised touch of the blind, but slowly and
carefully, frowning the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, thou wilt come with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;Nay, good Father, I may not; I am for St
Alban&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Westminster, good Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, thou mayest spare shoe-leather.&nbsp; I left
the Monastery but now, and, I warrant thee, they promise small
welcome to those from the pestilent cities.&nbsp; What
would&rsquo;st thou with the Abbat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius told him.</p>
<p>The friar flung up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Laus Deo</i>!&nbsp; <i>Laus Deo</i>!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;now I know thou art in very truth the lad of my
dream.&nbsp; Listen, my son, and I will tell thee all.&nbsp;
Thrice has the vision come to me; I see the mother who bore me
carried away, struggling and cursing, by men in black apparel,
and Hell is near at hand, belching out smoke and flame, and many
hideous devils; yet the place is little Bungay, where my mother
hath a cot by the river.&nbsp; When first the dream came I lay at
Mechlin in the Monastery there; my flesh quaked and my hair stood
up by reason of the awfulness of the vision; <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>then as I
mused and prayed I saw in it the call of the Lord, that I might
wrestle with Satan for my mother&rsquo;s soul, for she was ever
inclined to evil arts and spells, and thought little of aught
save gain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forthwith I suffered no man to stay me, and set off,
the Plague at my heels; but ever out-stripping it, I was careful
to preach its coming in every place, that men might turn and
repent.&nbsp; Then as I tarried on the seaboard for a ship the
Plague came; and because I had preached its coming, the people
rose in wrath, and, falling upon me, roughly handled me.&nbsp;
They beat me full sore in the market-place; then, piercing my
eyeballs, set me adrift in a small boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days and two nights I lay at the mercy of the sea,
darkness and light alike to me, and with no thought of time; for
the flames of hell burnt in my eyes, and a worse anguish in my
heart because of my mother&rsquo;s soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, and then?&rdquo; tried Hilarius breathlessly,
tears of pure pity in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Lord cared for me even as <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>He cared for
the Prophet Jonas, and sent a ship that His message might not be
hindered.&nbsp; The shipmen were kindly folk, but we were driven
out of our course by a great wind, and at last came ashore in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; I have come south thus far by the aid of
Christian men, but time presses; and now, lo! thou art here to
guide me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my Father,&rdquo; said poor Hilarius, seeing yet
another barrier in the way of his desires, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a
limner I would be; and I am from Westminster, not London, and
then there is Prior Stephen&rsquo;s letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friar held up his hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt be a limner, my son, the Lord hath revealed
it to me.&nbsp; Last night the vision came again, and a voice
cried: &lsquo;Speed, for a son of Christ waits by the way to
guide thy steps,&rsquo; and lo! thou art here, waiting by the
way, as the voice said.&nbsp; And now, son, an thou wilt come
thou shalt take thy letter to Wymondham&mdash;&rsquo;tis a cell
of this Abbey&mdash;for there is Brother Andreas from overseas
who hath <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>wondrous skill with the brush; he will teach thee, for
thou shalt say to him that Brother Amadeus sent thee, who is now
as Bartimeus, waiting for the light of the Lord; but first thou
shalt set me in that village of Bungay, where my mother
dwelleth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius listened, gazing awestruck at the withered eyes that
vainly questioned his face.&nbsp; He had forgotten plague, death,
flagellants, in this absorbing tale of the man of God, who was
even as one of the blessed martyrs.&nbsp; Brother Andreas!&nbsp;
A skilled limner!&nbsp; How should he, Hilarius, gainsay one with
a vision from the Lord?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I obey, my Father,&rdquo; he cried joyously, taking the
friar&rsquo;s hand; and they two passed swiftly down the road,
their faces to the east.</p>

72</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WHITE WAY AND WHERE IT LED</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a bitterly cold night and St
Agnes&rsquo; Eve; the snow fell heavily, caught into whirling
eddies by the keen north wind.&nbsp; Hilarius and the Friar,
crossing an empty waste of bleak unprotected heath, met the full
force of the blast, and each moment the snow grew denser, the
darkness more complete.&nbsp; They struggled on, breathless,
beaten, exhausted and lost; Hilarius, leading the Friar by one
hand, held the other across his bent head to shield himself from
the buffets of the wind.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stood fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can no more, Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the snow
is as a wall; there is naught to see or to hear; I deem we are
far from our right way.&rdquo;&nbsp; His voice was very weak, and
he caught at the Friar for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pray the Lord, my son, that He <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>open thine
eyes, even as He opened the eyes of the prophet&rsquo;s servant
in the besieged city; so shalt thou see a host of angels
encompassing us, for we are about the Lord&rsquo;s
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my Father,&rdquo; said Hilarius feebly, &ldquo;I
see no angels, and I perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; He tottered, and would
have fallen, but the Friar caught him in his arms.&nbsp; A moment
he stood irresolute, the boy on his breast, then flung away his
staff and lifted him to his shoulder.</p>
<p>With unerring, confident step he went forward through the
snow, a white figure bearing a white burden in a white
world.&nbsp; All at once the wind dropped, the blinding shower
ceased, and Hilarius, rested and comforted, spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it thou, my Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I, my son, but angels are on either hand and go
before to guide.&nbsp; The snow hath ceased, canst thou
walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set Hilarius gently on his feet, and lo! he found the stars
alight!</p>
<p>The boy gave a cry, and forgetting his <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>companion&rsquo;s darkness, pointed to the left where
lay a snow-clad village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle, a miracle, my Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle, i&rsquo; faith, my son: the Lord hath given
guidance to the blind as He promised.&nbsp; Let us go
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went by the white way under the stars; and Hilarius was
full of awe and comfort because of the angels of God which
attended on a poor friar.</p>
<p>At the village hostel they found rough but friendly
entertainment and several guests.&nbsp; They dried themselves at
a roaring fire, and Hilarius made a hearty meal; the Friar would
eat nothing save a morsel of bread.</p>
<p>A messenger was there, a short stout man with stubbly beard,
bright black eyes like beads, and a high colour.&nbsp; He was
riding with despatches from the King to the Abbat at Bury, and
had fearful tales to tell of the Plague; how in London they piled
the dead in trenches, while many who escaped the pest died of
want and cold; it was a city of the dead rather than <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the
living.&nbsp; One great lord, travelling post-haste from
Westminster, had been found by his servants to have the disorder,
and they fled, leaving him by the wayside to perish.</p>
<p>Hilarius heard horror-struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a grievous shame so to desert a sick
master,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, lad,&rdquo; said a chapman in the corner,
&ldquo;but a man loves his own skin best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said a fat ruddy-faced miller, overtaken
by the storm on his way to a neighbouring village, &ldquo;a
man&rsquo;s own skin before all.&nbsp; Fill your belly first and
your neighbour&rsquo;s afterwards.&nbsp; Live and let
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, let live,&rdquo; chimed in mine host, bustling in
with a stoop of cider for the chapman, &ldquo;but, by the Rood,
&rsquo;tis cruel work when two lone women are murdered for a bit
of mouldy bacon and a lump of bread; for I&rsquo;se warrant
&rsquo;tis a long day sin&rsquo; they had more than that at
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chapman took his cider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this work done?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Nay, where but here on the bruary!&nbsp; The
women were found Wednesday se&rsquo;n-night by the herd as he
went folding.&nbsp; They lay on the floor in their
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius turned sick.&nbsp; In Westminster, by some miracle,
he had been spared the sight of violent death&mdash;ay, or of
death in any form&mdash;and had seen nothing worse than a rogue
in the stocks, for which sight he had thanked Heaven piously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the fault of the rich,&rdquo; said a voice,
and Hilarius saw, to his surprise, that there was a second friar
in the room; a tall, bullet-headed man, with a heavy, obstinate
jaw ornamented with a scanty fringe of black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rich grow fat, and the poor starve,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis hunger makes a man kill his brother for a
mouthful of mouldy bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the miller, &ldquo;there was no need
to kill, Father.&nbsp; A man could have taken the meat from two
lone women and left them their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why take from folk as poor as themselves?&rdquo; <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>said mine
host.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them rob the rich an they must
rob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the friar, &ldquo;rob the rich, say
you, take their own, say I.&nbsp; God did not make this world
that one man should be over full and another go empty; nor is it
religion that the monks&rsquo; should live on the fat o&rsquo;
the land and grind the faces of the poor.&nbsp; How many manors,
think you, has the Abbat of St Edmund&rsquo;s, and how many on
his land lack bread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius listened, scarlet with indignation, a flood of
wrathful defence pent at his lips, for the blind friar laid a
restraining hand on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Mine host scratched his head doubtfully.&nbsp; The teaching
was seditious, and made a man liable to stocks and pillory; but
it tickled the ears of the common folk and &rsquo;twas ill to
quarrel with the Mendicants.&nbsp; Help came to him in his
perplexity: a loud knocking on the barred door made the guests
within start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis eight o&rsquo; the clock,&rdquo; said the
miller, affrighted, for he had a heavy purse on him.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;Let them knock and cool their hot heads,&rdquo;
said the seditious friar composedly.</p>
<p>The rest nodded approval.</p>
<p>Then a man&rsquo;s voice threatened without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho! unbar the door.&nbsp; Is this a night to keep
a man without?&nbsp; Open, open, or, by the Mass, thou shalt
smart for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mine host shook his head fearfully, and his fat cheeks
trembled; he moved slowly and unwillingly to the door and took
down the stout wooden bar.&nbsp; As it swung back the door flew
open, and a man burst in, at sight of whom mine host turned yet
paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food and drink,&rdquo; said the new-comer sharply,
flinging himself on a bench by the fire.</p>
<p>Hilarius thought he had never seen so strange a fellow.&nbsp;
His hair was close cropped; ay, and his ears also.&nbsp; His eyes
were very small and near together; his nose a shapeless lump; his
lip drawn up showed two rat-like teeth.&nbsp; Silence fell on the
company, and the chapman <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>who had been searching amongst his
goods for something wherewith to pay his hospitality, was hastily
putting them back, when the man, looking up, caught sight of a
bundle of oaten pipes among the miscellaneous wares.&nbsp; He
plucked one to him, and in a moment the air was full of tender
liquid notes&mdash;a thrush&rsquo;s roundelay.&nbsp; Then a
blackbird called and his mate answered; a cuckoo cried the
spring-song; a linnet mourned with lifting cadence; a nightingale
poured forth her deathless love.</p>
<p>Mine host came in with a dish piled high and a stoop of mead;
the man threw the pipe from him with a rough oath and fell to
ravenously on the victuals.&nbsp; He held his head low and ate
brutishly amid dead silence; then he looked up and cursed at them
for their sorry mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Hugh pipes and never a word of thanks nor a
jest?&nbsp; Damn you all for dull dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind friar rose and fixed his withered eyes on the
man&rsquo;s dreadful face.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&ldquo;Piping Hugh of Mildenhall,&rdquo; he said, and at
his voice the man leapt to his feet and thrust his arm out as if
for protection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Piping Hugh of Mildenhall,&rdquo;
said the Friar again, &ldquo;I have a message for thee from the
Lord God.&nbsp; I cried thee damned in my own name once, when
thou did&rsquo;st take my little sister to shame and death; now I
cry thee thrice damned in the name of the Lord, for the cup of
thine iniquity is full and thy hands red with blood.&nbsp; Man
hath branded thee; now God will set His mark on thee and all men
shall see it.&nbsp; The Plague will come and come swiftly, but it
shall not touch thee; many shall die in their sins; thou shalt
live on with thine.&nbsp; A brute thou art, and with brutes thou
shalt herd; thou shalt howl as a ravening wolf, and as such men
shall hunt thee from their doors.&nbsp; Thou shalt seek death,
even as Cain sought and found it not, because of the mark of the
Lord.&nbsp; Thou art damned, thrice damned; thy speech shall go
from thee, thy sight fail thee, thy mind be darkened; thou art <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>given over to
the Evil One, and he shall torment thee with
remembrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was dead silence; then with a long shrill howl the man
tore open the door, dashed from the house, and fled, a black
blotch upon the whiteness of the night.</p>
<p>The guests huddled together aghast, and no man moved, until
Hilarius, full of pride at his Friar&rsquo;s powers, stepped
forward to close the door.&nbsp; He was too late; it swung to
with a loud crash like the sound of doom.&nbsp; The Friar sank
back composedly on the bench, and the company began in silence to
make preparation for the night.&nbsp; When all was ordered,
Hilarius bade the Friar come, and he rose at the lad&rsquo;s
voice and touch.&nbsp; Then he crossed to where the others stood
apart eyeing him fearfully.</p>
<p>He laid his hand on the miller&rsquo;s breast and said in a
clear, low voice: &ldquo;Thou wilt die, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on the messenger&rsquo;s breast: &ldquo;Thou
wilt die, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>He laid
his hand on the chapman&rsquo;s breast: &ldquo;Thou wilt die,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid his hand on mine host&rsquo;s breast: &ldquo;Thou wilt
die, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he came to the other Friar who stood at a little
distance, his face dark with anger and fear, and laid his hand on
his breast: &ldquo;Thou wilt live, my brother&mdash;and
repent.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A DARK FINDING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a far cry from St
Alban&rsquo;s to Bungay&mdash;which village of the good ford lies
somewhat south-east of Norwich, five leagues distant&mdash;and
the journey is doubled in the winter time.&nbsp; Hilarius and the
Friar were long on the road, for January&rsquo;s turbulent mood
had imprisoned them many days, and early February had proved
little kinder.&nbsp; They had companied with folk, light <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>women and
brutal men; but, for the most part, coarse word and foul jest
were hushed in the presence of the blind friar and the lad with
the wondering eyes.&nbsp; In every village the Friar preached and
called on men to repent and be saved, for Death&rsquo;s shadow
was already upon them.&nbsp; Folk wondered and gaped&mdash;the
Plague was still only a name ten leagues east of London&mdash;but
many repented and confessed and made restitution, though some
heard with idle ears, remembering the prophecy of Brother Robert
who had come with the same message half a man&rsquo;s lifetime
before, and that no evil had followed his preaching.</p>
<p>At last St Matthias&rsquo; Eve saw Hilarius and the Friar at
St Edmund&rsquo;s Abbey.&nbsp; There were many guests for the
Convent&rsquo;s hospitality that night, and as Hilarius entered
the hall of the guest-house&mdash;a brother had charged himself
with the care of the Friar&mdash;he heard the sound of the
vielle, and a rich voice which sang in good round English against
the fashion of the day.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;Martin, Martin!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The vielle was instantly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hol&agrave;, lad!&rdquo; cried the Minstrel, springing
to his feet; he caught Hilarius to him and embraced him
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, lad, not back in thy monastery?&nbsp; Nay, but I
made sure the Plague would send thee flying home, and instead I
find thee strayed farther afield.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then seeing the
injured faces round him for that the song was not ended, he drew
Hilarius to the bench beside him and took up his vielle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be still now, lad, &rsquo;til I have finished my ditty for
this worshipful company; then, an&rsquo;t please thee to tell it,
I will hear thy tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests, who had looked somewhat sour at the interruption,
unpursed their lips, and settled to listen as the minstrel took
up his song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The fair maid came to the old oak tree<br
/>
(Sun and wind and a bird on the bough),<br />
The throstle he sang merrily&mdash;merrily&mdash;merrily,<br />
But the fair maid wept, for sad was she, sad was she,<br />
Her sweet knight&mdash;Oh! where was he?</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>He lay
dead in the cold, cold ground<br />
(Moon and stars and rain on the hill),<br />
In his side and breast were bloody wounds.<br />
Woe, woe is me for the fair ladye, and the poor knight he,<br />
The poor knight&mdash;Ah! cold was he.</p>
<p>The maiden sat her down to die<br />
(Cold, cold earth on her lover&rsquo;s breast),<br />
And the little birds rang mournfully,<br />
And the moonshine kissed her tenderly,<br />
And the stars looked down right pityingly<br />
On the poor fair maid and the poor cold knight.<br />
Ah misery, dear misery, sweet misery!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This mournful song was no sooner ended than supper was served;
and the company proved themselves good trenchermen.&nbsp;
Hilarius caught sight of the seditious friar making short work of
the Convent&rsquo;s victuals, and marvelled to see him in a place
to which he had given so evil a name.</p>
<p>Martin was unfeignedly glad to see the lad, and listened
intently to his tale.&nbsp; He nodded his head as Hilarius
related how the friar he companied with preached in each village
that men should repent ere the scourge of God fell upon them;
&ldquo;but there is naught of it as yet,&rdquo; said the lad.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;Nay, nay, it is like a thief in the night.&nbsp;
One day it is not; and then the next, men sicken and fall like
blasted wheat.&nbsp; I heard a bruit of London that it was but a
heap of graves&mdash;nay, one grave rather, for they flung the
bodies into a great trench; there was no time to do otherwise:
Black Death is swift with his stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Hilarius told of Piping Hugh and the Friar&rsquo;s
death-words to the guests.</p>
<p>Martin swore a round oath and slapped his thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now know I that thy Friar is a proper man an he has set
a curse on Piping Hugh of Mildenhall!&nbsp; A foul-mouthed knave,
with many a black deed to his name and blood on his hands, if men
say truth; and yet there was never a bird that would not come at
his call, and I never heard tell that he harmed one.&nbsp; What
will thy Friar in Bungay, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had heard the story of the Friar&rsquo;s
twice-repeated vision and quest, the Minstrel sat silent awhile
with knitted brow and head sunk on his breast; then <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>he eyed
Hilarius half humorously, half tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks, lad, an thy Friar alloweth it, I will even go
to Bungay with thee; for I love thee well, lad, and would have
thy company.&nbsp; Also I like not the matter of the vision and
would fain see the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the dream came again to the Friar, and a voice
cried: &ldquo;Haste, haste, ere it be too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
so Hilarius and Martin came to Bungay, the Friar guiding them,
for the way was his own.&nbsp; None of the three ever saw St
Edmund&rsquo;s Abbey again, for in one short month the minster
with its sister churches was turned to be a spital-house, while
the dead lay in heaps, silently waiting to summon to their
ghastly company the living that sought to make them a bed.</p>
<p>Quaint little Bungay lay snug enough in the embrace of the low
vine-crowned hills which half encircled common and town.&nbsp;
The Friar strode forward, straining in his pace like a leashed
hound; Martin and <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>Hilarius following.&nbsp; Once he stopped and turned a
stricken face on his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he said shrilly.</p>
<p>A magpie went ducking across the road, and Hilarius crossed
himself fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us make haste,&rdquo; cried the Friar when they
told him; and so at full pace they came to Bungay town.</p>
<p>The place looked empty and deserted, but from the distance
came the roar and hum of an angry crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people are abroad,&rdquo; said Martin, and his face
was very grave, &ldquo;no doubt some knight is here, and there is
a bear-baiting on the common.&nbsp; Prithee, where is thy
mother&rsquo;s dwelling, good Father, and I will go and ask news
of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a lonely hovel by the waterside not far from
the Cattle Gate; Goody Wooten thou shalt ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin went swiftly forward over the Common; Hilarius and the
Friar followed more slowly, and when they came to the Cattle Gate
they stood fast and waited, the Friar turning his head anxiously
and <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>straining to make his ears do a double service.</p>
<p>Hilarius, who had hitherto regarded Bungay and the
Friar&rsquo;s business as the last stage of his journey to
Wymondham and Brother Andreas, was full of foreboding; he watched
Martin on the outskirts of the crowd, saw him throw up his hands
with an angry gesture and point to the Friar.&nbsp; Then he fell
to parleying with the people, but Hilarius was too far off to
catch what was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there, &rsquo;tis her son,&rdquo; Martin was saying
vehemently; &ldquo;yon holy friar hath seen this thing in a
vision, but alack! he reads it otherwise; yea, and hath hasted
hither from overseas to wrestle with the Evil One for his
mother&rsquo;s soul&mdash;and now, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd parted, and he saw the most miserable sight.&nbsp;
An old woman lay on the ground by the river&rsquo;s edge; a
bundle of filthy water-logged rags crowned by a bruised,
vindictive face and grey hair smeared with filth and slime.&nbsp;
She lay <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>on
her back a shapeless huddle; her right thumb tied to her left toe
and so across: there was a rope about her middle, but in their
hot haste they had not stayed to strip her.</p>
<p>Martin pressed forward, and then turning to the jeering,
vengeful crowd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Christ&rsquo;s Rood, this is an evil work ye have
wrought,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said one of the bystanders, &ldquo;but it
was fair judgment, Minstrel.&nbsp; For years she hath worked her
spells and black arts in this place, ay, and cattle have perished
and women gone barren through her means.&nbsp; Near two days
agone a child was lost and seen last near her door, ay, and never
seen again.&nbsp; When we came to question her she cursed at us
for meddling mischief-makers, and would but glare and spit, and
swear she knew naught of the misbegotten brat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe &rsquo;twas true eno&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
Martin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hate these rough-cast
witch-findings&mdash;&rsquo;tis not a matter for man&rsquo;s
judgment, unless &rsquo;tis sworn and proven in court before the
Justiciary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; joined in an old man, &ldquo;what
need of a Justice when God speaks?&nbsp; We did but thole her to
the river to see if she would sink or swim.&nbsp; The witch did
swim, as all can testify, her Master helping her; and seeing
that, we drew her under&mdash;ay, and see her now as she lies,
and say whether the Devil hath not set a mark on his
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin wrung his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of Christ, lay her decently on her pallet,
and say no word of this to yon holy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moved by his earnest manner, one or two more kindly folk
busied themselves unfastening the ropes and thongs which bound
the witch, and bore her to her wretched bed.</p>
<p>The people, in their previous eagerness, had torn down the
front of the miserable hovel she called home, so all men could
see the poor place and its dead dishonoured mistress.</p>
<p>Martin, finding his bidding accomplished, turned to meet
Hilarius and the Friar who <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>were now coming slowly across the
windswept common.&nbsp; March mists gathered and draped the
sluggish river; the dry reeds rattled dismally in the ooze and
sedge.&nbsp; Hilarius shivered, and the Friar started nervously
when Martin spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friar,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God comfort thee!&nbsp;
After all thy pains thou art too late to speed thy mother&rsquo;s
soul; she passed to-day, and lies even now awaiting burial at thy
faithful hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Friar drew a quick breath, and Hilarius questioned Martin
with a look.&nbsp; The crowd parted to let them through, and hung
their heads abashed in painful silence as the Friar, led by
Hilarius, gave his blessing.</p>
<p>They were close to the mean hovel now, and he turned to
Martin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didst thou hear of her end, or did she die alone, for
the people feared her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, she died alone,&rdquo; answered Martin, and
muttered, &ldquo;now God forgive me!&rdquo; under his breath.</p>
<p>As they went into the wretched shed the <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>setting sun
broke through the lowering grey clouds and shone full on the dead
woman.&nbsp; It lighted each vicious line and hideous trait of
the wrinkled, toothless face, and betrayed the mark of an evil
life, surcharged with horrid fear.</p>
<p>Hilarius shrank back shuddering.&nbsp; Could this hideousness
be death?&nbsp; The Friar stepped forward, but Martin stayed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, touch her not, Father, it may be the pestilence as
thou didst read in thy dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Friar fell on his knees; and, in the silence that followed
was heard the drip, drip, drip, from the sodden rags on the
beaten earth floor.&nbsp; The people without, staring,
open-mouthed and silent, saw the Friar look up; his hand hastily
outstretched touched the dank, muddy hair; then he knew all, and
fell on his face with an exceeding bitter cry.&nbsp; It was
answered by another cry&mdash;the glad cry of a lost child that
is found.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Friar, standing in front of that hovel <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>of death,
preached to the cringing, terrified people, many of whom knelt
and crouched in the down-trodden grass and quag.&nbsp; He threw
up his arms, and turned his blind, anguished face to the setting
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that
take counsel but not of Me, that they may add sin to sin.&nbsp;
Darkness shall come upon them; Death shall overtake them; their
place shall know them no more.&nbsp; Let them bare their backs to
the scourge, let them confess and repent ere I visit them as I
visited Sodom and Gomorrah, cities of the Plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ye people, ye have taken judgment in your hands and
judged falsely withal; but ye shall be judged in truth, yea, even
according to your measure.&nbsp; Repent, repent, for Death cometh
swiftly and maketh no long tarrying.&nbsp; It shall come; it
shall snatch men&rsquo;s souls away, even as ye have torn away my
mother&rsquo;s soul, leaving no space for repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stretched his hands out over the common, and pointed to the
little town.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Your dwellings shall be desolate, and this place
a place of heaps.&nbsp; Ye shall run hither and thither, seeking
safety and finding none; for the arm of the Lord is stretched out
still because of the wickedness of the earth.&nbsp; Woe, woe,
woe, a disobedient and gainsaying people!&nbsp; Woe, woe, woe, a
people hating righteousness and loving iniquity!&nbsp; The Lord
shall straightway destroy them from off the face of the
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made an imperative gesture of dismissal, and first one and
then another in the crowd turned to slink home like beaten dogs,
snarling, growling, but afraid.</p>
<p>Hilarius and Martin buried the witch at the back of her
wretched den; and the Friar, the priest lost in the son, prayed
long by the else unhallowed grave, and Martin prayed beside
him.</p>
<p>Hilarius stood apart, his lips set straight, and said no
prayer; for what availed it to pray for an unassoilzied witch who
had met her due, damned alike by God and man?</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Martin
came up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was his mother,&rdquo; he said, as if making
excuse.</p>
<p>Hilarius stared in bewilderment.&nbsp; His mother?&nbsp; Ay,
but an evil liver; and the people of Bungay had wrought a good
work in sending her to her own place.&nbsp; He crossed himself
piously at the thought of the near neighbourhood of devils busied
with a thrice-damned soul.</p>
<p>Martin led them out of Bungay by the Earsham road, and the
Friar clung to him like a little child, for the strength of his
vision was spent.&nbsp; They lay that night with a friendly
shepherd; but only one slept, and that one Hilarius.&nbsp; He lay
on a truss of sweet-smelling hay, and dreamt of Wymondham and
Brother Andreas; of gold, vermilion and blue; of wondrous
pictures, and a great name: and the scent of the pine forest at
home swept across his quiet sleep.</p>
<p>On the morrow came the parting of the ways, for Hilarius was
all aglow for Wymondham, and Martin had charged <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>himself with
the Friar at least as far as Norwich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well lead a blind friar as sing blindly at
another&rsquo;s bidding,&rdquo; he said whimsically, and so they
bade one another farewell never to meet again in this world: for
Martin and the Friar went to Yarmouth, not Norwich, and there
they perished among the first when the east wind swept the Plague
thither in a boat-load of sickened shipmen.&nbsp; And
Hilarius&mdash;once again the Angel of the Lord stood in the path
of his desires.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE COMING OF HUNGER AND LOVE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Hilarius</span> fared but slowly; it was
ill travelling on a high-road in good weather, but on a
cross-road in the spring!&mdash;that was a time to commend
oneself body and soul to the Saints.&nbsp; He walked <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>warily,
picking his way in and out of the bog between fence and ditch,
which was all that remained to show where the piety of the past
once kept a road.&nbsp; The low land to his left was submerged, a
desolate tract giving back a sullen grey sky, lifeless, barren,
save where a gaunt poplar like the mast of a sunken ship broke
the waste of waters.</p>
<p>The sight brought Hilarius&rsquo; thoughts sharply back to the
events of the evening before.&nbsp; Wonderful indeed were the
judgments of God!&nbsp; A witch&mdash;plainly proved to be
such&mdash;had been struck dead in the midst of her sins; and
London, that light-minded, reprobate city, was a heap of
graves.&nbsp; Now he, Hilarius, having seen much evil and the
justice of the Almighty, would get him in peace to Wymondham,
there to learn to be a cunning limner; and having so learnt would
joyfully hie him back to Prior Stephen and his own monastery.</p>
<p>Presently the way led somewhat uphill, and he saw to his right
a small <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>hamlet.&nbsp; It lay some distance off his road, but he
was sharp-set, for the shepherd&rsquo;s fare had been meagre; and
so turned aside in the hope of an ale-house.&nbsp; There was no
side road visible, and he struck across the dank, marshy fields
until he lighted on a rude track which led to the group of
cottages.&nbsp; The place struck him as strangely quiet; no smoke
rose from the chimneys; no dogs rushed out barking furiously at a
stranger&rsquo;s advent.&nbsp; The first hovel he passed was
empty, the open door showed a fireless hearth.&nbsp; At the
second he knocked and heard a sound of scuffling within.&nbsp; As
no one answered his repeated summons he pushed the door open; the
low room was desolate, but two bright eyes peered at him from a
corner,&mdash;&rsquo;twas a rat.&nbsp; Hilarius turned away,
sudden fear at his heart, and passed on, finding in each hovel
only empty silence.</p>
<p>Apart from the rest, standing alone in a field, was a somewhat
larger cottage; a bush swung from the projecting pole above the
door: it was the ale-house that he <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>sought; here, at least, he would
find some one.&nbsp; As he came up he heard a child crying, and
lo! on the doorstep sat a dirty little maid of some four summers,
sobbing away for dear life.</p>
<p>Hilarius approached diffidently, and stooped down to wipe away
the grimy tears.</p>
<p>The child regarded him, round eyes, open mouth; then with a
shrill cry of joy, she held out her thin arms.</p>
<p>At the sound of her cry the door opened; on the threshold
stood a woman still young but haggard and weary-eyed; at her
breast was a little babe.&nbsp; She stared at Hilarius, and then
pulling the child to her in the doorway, waved him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off, fool!&mdash;&rsquo;tis the
Plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius shrank back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thy neighbours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, they were light-footed eno&rsquo; when they saw
what was to do, and left us three to die like rats in a
hole.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then eagerly: &ldquo;Hast thou any
bread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;Nay, I came here seeking some.&nbsp; Art thou
hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw out her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis two days sin&rsquo; I had bite or
sup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where lies the nearest village? and how far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A matter of an hour, over yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, goodwife,&rdquo; said Hilarius, &ldquo;I will go
buy thee food and come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So said another, and he never came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but perchance some evil befell him,&rdquo; said
gentle Hilarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will trust thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went in and
returned with a few small coins.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all I
have.&nbsp; Tell no man whence thou art, else they will hunt thee
from their doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius nodded, took the money, and ran as fast as he could
go in the direction of the village.</p>
<p>The woman watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it fear or love that lends him that <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>pace?&rdquo; she muttered, as she sat down to wait.</p>
<p>It was love.</p>
<p>Hilarius entered the village discreetly, and adding the little
money he had to the woman&rsquo;s scanty store, bought bread, a
flask of wine, flour and beans, and a jug of milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for a sick child,&rdquo; he said when he
asked for it, and the woman pushed back the money, bidding him
God-speed.</p>
<p>The return journey was accomplished much more slowly, because
of his precious burden; and as he crossed a field, there, dead in
a snare, lay a fine coney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hath Our Lady herself had thought for the poor
mother!&rdquo; cried Hilarius joyously, and added it to his
store.</p>
<p>When he reached the cottage, and the woman saw the food, she
broke into loud weeping, for her need had been great; then, as if
giving up the struggle to another and a stronger, she sank on the
bed with her fast-failing babe in her arms.</p>
<p>Hilarius fed her carefully with bread <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and
wine&mdash;not for nothing had he served the Infirmarian when
blood-letting had proved too severe for some weak
Brother&mdash;and then turned his attention to the little maid
who sat patient, eyeing the food.</p>
<p>For her, bread and milk.&nbsp; He sat down on a low stool, and
taking the child on his knee slowly supplied the gaping,
bird-like mouth.&nbsp; At last the little maid heaved a sigh of
content, leant her flaxen head against her nurse&rsquo;s
shoulder, and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>Hilarius, cradling her carefully in gentle arms, crooned
softly to her, thrilling with tenderness.&nbsp; She was his own,
his little sister, the child he had found and saved.&nbsp; Surely
Our Lady had guided him to her, and her great Mother-love would
shield this little one from a foul and horrid death.&nbsp; In
that dirty, neglected room, the child warm against his breast,
Hilarius lived the happiest moments of his life.</p>
<p>Presently he rose, for there was much to be done, kissed the
little pale cheek, noted fearfully the violet shadows under <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the closed
eyes, and laid his new-found treasure on the bed by her
mother.</p>
<p>The woman was half-asleep, but started awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou going?&rdquo; she said, and despair gazed at
him from her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, surely not until we all go together,&rdquo;
he said soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would but kindle a fire, for
the cold is bitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wood was plentiful, and soon a bright fire blazed on the
hearth.&nbsp; The poor woman, heartened by her meal, rose and
came to sit by it, and stretching out her thin hands to the
grateful warmth, told her tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Gammer Harden&rsquo;s son who first heard
tell of a strange new sickness at Caxton&rsquo;s; and then Jocell
had speech with a herd from those parts, who was fleeing to a
free town, because of some ill he had done.&nbsp; Next day Jocell
fell sick with vomitings, and bleeding, and breaking out of
boils, and in three days he lay dead; and Gammer Harden fell sick
and died likewise.&nbsp; Then one cried &rsquo;twas the Plague,
and <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>the
wrath of God; and they fled&mdash;the women to the nuns at
Bungay, and the men to seek work or shelter on the Manor; but us
they left, for I was with child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thy husband?&rsquo; said Hilarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, he was not my husband, but these are his children,
his and mine.&nbsp; Some hold &rsquo;tis a sin to live thus, and
perhaps because of it this evil hath fallen upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the babe lying on her lap, its waxen face drawn
and shrunk with the stress of its short life.</p>
<p>Hilarius spoke gently:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a grievous sin against God and His Church
to live together out of holy wedlock, and perchance &rsquo;tis
true that for this very thing thou hast been afflicted, even as
David the great King.&nbsp; But since thou didst sin ignorantly
the Lord in His mercy sent me to serve thee in thy sore need; ay,
and in very truth, Our Lady herself showed me where the coney lay
snared.&nbsp; Let us pray God by His dear Mother to forgive us
our sins and to have mercy on these little ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>And
kneeling there in the firelight he besought the great Father for
his new-found family.</p>
<p>Five days passed, and despite extreme care victuals were
short.&nbsp; Hilarius dug up roots from the hedgerows, and went
hungry, but at last the pinch came; the woman was too weak and
ill to walk, the babe scarce in life&mdash;there could be no
thought of flight&mdash;and the little maid grew white, and wan
and silent.&nbsp; Then it came to Hilarius that he would once
again beg food in the village where he had sought help
before.</p>
<p>He went slowly, for he had eaten little that his maid might be
the better fed, and he was very sad.&nbsp; When he reached the
village he found his errand like to be vain.&nbsp; News of the
Plague was coming from many parts, and each man feared for his
own skin.&nbsp; At every house they questioned him: &ldquo;Art
thou from a hamlet where the Plague hath been?&rdquo; and when he
answered &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; the door was shut.</p>
<p>Very soon men, angry and afraid, came to drive him from the
place.&nbsp; He gained <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>the village cross, and prayed them
for love of the Saviour and His holy Rood to give him bread for
his little maid and her mother.&nbsp; Let them set it in the
street, he would take it and cross no man&rsquo;s
threshold.&nbsp; Surely they could not; for shame, let a little
child die of want?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis better they die, so are we safe,&rdquo;
cried a voice; then they fell upon him and beat him, and drove
him from the village with blows and curses.</p>
<p>Bruised and panting, he ran from them, and at last the chase
ceased; breathless and exhausted he flung himself under a
hedge.</p>
<p>A hawk swooped, struck near him, and rose again with its
prey.&nbsp; Hilarius shuddered; but perhaps the hawk had
nestlings waiting open-mouthed for food?&nbsp; His little
maid!&nbsp; His eyes filled with tears as he thought of those who
awaited him.&nbsp; He picked up a stone, and watched if perchance
a coney might show itself.&nbsp; He had never killed, but were
not his nestlings agape?</p>
<p>Nothing stirred, but along the road came <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>a waggon of
strange shape and gaily painted.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet, praying the great Mother to send him help
in his awful need.</p>
<p>The waggon drew near; the driver sat asleep upon the shaft,
the horse took his own pace.&nbsp; It passed him before he could
pluck up heart to ask an alms, and from the back dangled a small
sack and a hen.&nbsp; If he begged and was refused his little
maid must die.&nbsp; A minute later the sack and the hen had
changed owners&mdash;but not unobserved; a clear voice called a
halt; the waggon stood fast; two figures sprang out, a girl and a
boy: and Hilarius stood before them on the white highway&mdash;a
thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize the knave!&rdquo; cried the girl sharply.</p>
<p>Hilarius stared at her and she at him.&nbsp; It was his
dancer, and she knew him, ay, despite the change of dress and
scene, she knew him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; The worthy novice turned worldling and
thief!&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;tis a rare jest.&nbsp; What of thy fine
sermons now, good preacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hilarius answered never a word; <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>overcome by
shame, grief, and hunger, sudden darkness fell upon him.</p>
<p>When he came to himself he was sitting propped against the
hedge; the waggon was drawn up by the roadside, and the dancer
and her brother stood watching him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch bread and wine,&rdquo; said the girl, and to
Hilarius who tried to speak, &ldquo;Peace, &rsquo;til thou hast
eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius ate eagerly, and when he had made an end the dancer
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell thy tale.&nbsp; Prithee, since when didst thou
leave thy Saints and thy nursery for such an ill trade as
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius told her all, and when he had finished he wept
because of his little maid, and his were not the only tears.</p>
<p>The dancer went to the waggon and came back with much food
taken from her store, to which she added the hen; the sack held
but fodder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Gia,&rdquo; grumbled her brother, &ldquo;there
will be naught for us to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou canst eat bread, or else go hungry,&rdquo; <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>she
retorted, and filled a small sack with the victuals.</p>
<p>Hilarius watched her, hardly daring to hope.&nbsp; She held it
out to him: &ldquo;Now up and off to thy little maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius took the sack, but only to lay it down again.&nbsp;
Kneeling, he took both her little brown hands, and his tears fell
fast as he kissed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maid, maid, canst forgive my theft, ay, and my hard
words in the forest?&nbsp; God help me for a poor, blind
fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;there is naught to
forgive; and see, thou hast learnt to hunger and to love!&nbsp;
Farewell, little brother, we pass here again a fortnight hence,
and I would fain have word of thy little maid.&nbsp; Ay, and
shouldst thou need a home for her, bring her to us; my old
grandam is in the other waggon and she will care for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius ran across the fields, full of sorrow for his sin,
and yet greatly glad because of the wonderful goodness of
God.</p>
<p>When he got back his little maid sat <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>alone by
the fire.&nbsp; He hastened to make food ready, but the child was
far spent and would scarcely eat.&nbsp; Then he went out to find
the woman.</p>
<p>He saw her standing in the doorway of an empty hovel, and she
cried to him to keep back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My babe is dead, and I feel the sickness on me.&nbsp; I
went to the houses seeking meal, even to Gammer Harden&rsquo;s;
and I must die.&nbsp; As for thee, thou shalt not come near me,
but bide with the child; so maybe God will spare the
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius besought her long that she would at least suffer him
to bring her food, but she would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I could not eat, the fever burns in my bones; let
me alone that I may die the sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius went back with a heavy heart, and lay that night with
the little maid in his arms on the settle by the hearth.&nbsp;
Despite his fear he slept heavily and late: when he rose the sun
was high and the child awake.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>He
fed her, and, bidding her bide within, went out to gain tidings
of the poor mother.&nbsp; He called, but no one answered; and the
door of the hovel in which she had taken shelter stood
wide.&nbsp; Then, as he searched the fields, fearing the fever
had driven her abroad, he saw the flutter of garments in a ditch;
and lo! there lay the woman, dead, with her dead babe on her
breast.&nbsp; She had lain down to die alone with God in the
silence, that haply the living might escape; and on her face was
peace.</p>
<p>Later, Hilarius laid green boughs tenderly over mother and
babe, and covered them with earth, saying many prayers.&nbsp;
Then he went back to his fatherless, motherless maid.</p>
<p>She ailed naught that he could see, and there was food and to
spare; but each day saw her paler and thinner, until at last she
could not even sit, but lay white and silent in Hilarius&rsquo;
tender arms; and he fought with death for his little maid.</p>
<p>Then on a day she would take no food, and when Hilarius put
tiny morsels in her <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>mouth she could not swallow; and so
he sat through the long hours, his little maid in his arms, with
no thought beside.&nbsp; The darkness came, and he waited
wide-eyed, praying for the dawn.&nbsp; When the new day broke and
the east was pale with light he carried the child out that he
might see her, for a dreadful fear possessed him.&nbsp; And it
came to pass that when the light kissed her little white face she
opened her eyes and smiled at Hilarius, and so smiling, died.</p>
<p>The dancer, true to her promise, scanned the road as the
waggon drew near the place of Hilarius&rsquo; first and last
theft: he was standing by the wayside alone.&nbsp; The waggon
passed on carrying him with it; and the dancer looked but once on
his face and asked no question.</p>

117</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOW LONG, O LORD, HOW LONG!</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Monastery by the forest pursued
an even existence, with no great event to trouble its serenity,
for it lay too far west for the Plague to be more than a terrible
name.</p>
<p>True, there had been dissension when Prior Stephen, summoned
to Cluny by the Abbat, had perforce left the dominion to the
Sub-Prior.&nbsp; For lo! the Sub-Prior, a mild and most amiable
man in his own estate, had proved harsh and overbearing in
government.&nbsp; Ay, and in an irate mood he had fallen upon
Brother William, the Sacrist, in the Frater, plucked out his hair
and beaten him sore; whereat the Convent was no little
scandalized, and counselled Brother William to resign his <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>office.&nbsp; He flouted the Chamberlain also, and
Brother Roger the Hospitaller, and so affronted the Brethren that
when he began to sing the <i>Verba mea</i> on leaving the
chapter, the Convent&mdash;yea, even the novices&mdash;were
silent, to show their displeasure.</p>
<p>When Prior Stephen returned he was exceeding wroth, but said
little; only he took from the Sub-Prior his office, and all that
appertained thereto, and made him as one of the other monks; and
Brother William, who was a gentle and devout servant of God, he
made Sub-Prior in his stead; and the Convent was at peace.</p>
<p>Brother Ambrose, he to whom the vision was vouchsafed, had
slipped through the grey veil which once hid Jerusalem from his
longing gaze; Brother Richard was now in the land where the blind
receive their sight; and Brother Thomas the Cellarer&mdash;but of
him let us say little and think with charity; for &rsquo;tis to
be feared that he greatly abused his office and is come to
judgment.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Two
of the older monks, Brother Anselm and Brother Paul, who had
spent fifty years in the sheltered peace of the Monastery walls,
sat warming their tired old limbs in the south cloister, for the
summer sunshine was very pleasant to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Brother Thomas died&mdash;&rdquo; began Brother
Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord have mercy on his soul!&rdquo; ejaculated
Brother Anselm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Brother Thomas died,&rdquo; said Brother Paul
again&mdash;a little impatiently, though he crossed himself
piously enough&mdash;&ldquo;methinks the provisions have oft been
scanty and far from tempting, Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and the wine,&rdquo; said Brother Anselm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Methinks our Cellarer draws the half of it from the
Convent&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook their heads sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Brother Anselm after a short
silence, &ldquo;our Cellarer is most worthy, strict, and honest
in the performance of his office&mdash;while Brother Thomas,
alack&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;Methinks Brother Edmund is somewhat remiss also
in his duties,&rdquo; said Brother Paul.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Prior,
holy man, perceives nothing of these things.&nbsp; On
Sunday&rsquo;s feast one served him with a most unsavoury mess in
the refectory, the dish thereof being black and broken; yet he
ate the meat in great content, and seemingly with
appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is but young, he is but young&mdash;sixty come
Michaelmas&mdash;sixty, and twenty-two years
Prior&mdash;&rsquo;tis a long term,&rdquo; and Brother Anselm
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, he is still young, and of sound teeth,&rdquo; said
Brother Paul, &ldquo;whereas thou and I, Brother, are as babes
needing pap-meat.&nbsp; Brother Thomas&mdash;God rest his
soul!&mdash;was wont to give savoury mess easy of eating to the
elder Brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, he was a kind man with all his faults,&rdquo; said
Brother Anselm, fingering his toothless gums.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think
you &rsquo;twould be well to speak of this matter to the
Prior?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;he is ever
against any store being set on the things of <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>this
world&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;tis well for the greater discipline of
the flesh,&rsquo; so saith he ever.&nbsp; Still he hath forbidden
the blood-letting to us elder Brethren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks there is little to let, since Brother Thomas
died,&rdquo; said Brother Anselm ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, let us seek out the Cellarer and admonish
him&mdash;maybe he will hear a word in season,&rdquo; and the two
old monks moved slowly away to the Cellarer&rsquo;s office as
Prior Stephen came down the cloister walk.</p>
<p>He looked little older, his carriage was upright as ever, but
government sat heavy upon him; the keen, ascetic face was weary,
and the line of the lips showed care.&nbsp; His thoughts were
busy with Hilarius.&nbsp; It was now full six years that the lad
had left the Monastery, and since the Christmas after his going
no news had come of him, save that he never reached St
Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Had the Plague gathered him as it gathered
many another well-beloved son?&nbsp; Or had the awakening proved
too sudden for the lad set blind-eyed without the gate?</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>He
passed from the cloister into the garth where bloomed the lilies
that Hilarius had loved so well.&nbsp; He looked at the row of
nameless graves with the great Rood for their common memorial;
last but one lay the resting-place of Brother Richard, and the
blind monk&rsquo;s dying speech had been of the lad whose face he
had strained his eyes to see.</p>
<p>Prior Stephen stood by the farmery door, and the scent of
Mary&rsquo;s flowers came to him as it had come to Hilarius at
the gate.&nbsp; He stretched out his hands with the strange
pathetic gesture of a strong man helpless.&nbsp; It was all
passing fair: the fields of pale young corn trembling in the
gentle breeze; the orchards and vineyards with fast maturing
fruit; the meadows where the sleek kine browsed languidly in the
warm summer sunshine.&nbsp; Peace and prosperity everywhere; the
old Church springing into new beauty as the spire rose slowly
skywards; peace and prosperity, new glories for the House of the
Lord; and yet, and yet, his heart ached for his own helplessness,
and for the exceeding <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>longing that he had for the boy
whose mother once held that heart in the hollow of her little
hand.</p>
<p>Ah well, blessed be God who had called him from the things of
this world to the service of Christ and the Church!&nbsp; Once
again he offered himself in the flame of his desires: he would
fast and pray and wait.</p>
<p>The Office bell sounded sharp and clear across the still
summer air calling to Vespers, and the Prior hasted to his
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qui seminant in lachrymis in exultatione
metent</i>,&rdquo; chanted the deep voices of the monks, and
Prior Stephen&rsquo;s voice trembled as he joined in the
Psalmody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Euntes ibant et flebant mittentes semina
sua</i>.&nbsp; <i>Venientes autem venient cum exultatione
portantes manipulos suos</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had sown in tears, ay, and was weary of the sowing; but the
harvesting was not yet.</p>

124</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MARY&rsquo;S LILIES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> came to pass upon a certain day
scarce a se&rsquo;nnight later, that Prior Stephen was troubled
in his mind by reason of a dream which came to him.</p>
<p>It happened on this wise.&nbsp; He was sitting by his window
after the noon repast, musing, as he was wont, on his dear
son.&nbsp; The song of the bees busy in the herb-garden was very
pleasant to his ear, the warm, still air overcame him, and he
slept.&nbsp; Suddenly he heard a voice calling&mdash;a voice he
knew in every fibre of his being and yet could set no name to,
for it was the voice of God.&nbsp; He arose in haste and went out
into the garth, and lo! under the lilies Hilarius lay
sleeping.&nbsp; The Prior stood fast in great wonder, his heart
leaping for joy; yet he could not cross the little piece of grass
that lay between the cloister and the farmery door.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>As he
watched, a woman, light of foot and of great beauty, came swiftly
from the gate to where Hilarius slept; and the Prior was grieved,
and marvelled that the porter had opened to such an one; for it
was a grave scandal that a woman should set foot within the
Monastery precincts.&nbsp; He strove to cry, but his voice died
on his lips, and his feet were as lead.</p>
<p>The woman stayed when she came to the sleeping lad, and
stooped to arouse him, but he slept on.&nbsp; She called him, and
her voice was as the calling of the summer sea on a shelving
beach; but Hilarius gave no heed.&nbsp; Then, in great
impatience, she caught at the white lilies under which he lay;
and, as she broke the flower-crowned stems, Hilarius stirred and
cried out in his sleep, whereat she plucked the faster.&nbsp; Of
a sudden Prior Stephen was as one set free.&nbsp; He strode to
the woman&rsquo;s side: there was but one lily left.&nbsp; He
laid his hand on her shoulder, for speech was still far from him:
and she <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>fell back from the one remaining blossom with a cry of
fear&mdash;and Prior Stephen awoke, for behold! it was a dream;
but he was sore troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;evil threatens the lad,
such evil as slew his mother, on whom God have
mercy!&rdquo;&nbsp; And sighing heavily he took his way to the
great Rood and made supplication for his son.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Far away, under a southern sky, in one of the great palaces of
Florence, there stood a woman of fair stature, with
tight-clenched hands, whose many jewels bit the tender
flesh.&nbsp; Her russet eyes flashed under threatening brows, her
teeth held fast the curling upper lip.&nbsp; Great, alack! was
her fame: men crept to her knee like spaniels craving
favour.&nbsp; Great was her wealth: a golden piece for every
ruddy strand that hung a shimmering mantle to her knee.&nbsp; Her
beauty&mdash;nay, men had slain themselves gladly to escape the
torment of her look.&nbsp; She stood in the curtained doorway, a
heavy purple hanging at her back; and <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the man who awaited her paled as he
saw her vengeful face.</p>
<p>It was Hilarius.&nbsp; He drew himself up to the full of his
slender height, and bowed.</p>
<p>Panting a little, the woman came towards him across the
many-hued marble floors; and, as she passed, a vase of great
white lilies caught in her draperies of cramoisie and fell.&nbsp;
She gave no heed, but swept on, and faced him in the sunny
silence.&nbsp; Across the pause the Angelus sounded from a church
hard by: Hilarius crossed himself devoutly; and the stillness
fled before a woman&rsquo;s scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, then, Signor,&rdquo; she cried mockingly,
&ldquo;is ours to be a war of signs and silence?&nbsp; I have
heard thy lips were ready enough with judgment, though they halt
at a love-phrase.&nbsp; By Our Lady, if all that is said of thee
be true, I will e&rsquo;en have thee whipped at the gibbet for
thy gibes!&nbsp; Speak, fool, while thy tongue is left thee;
&rsquo;tis a last asking.&nbsp; Wilt thou paint this face of mine
that is, it seems, <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>so little to thy liking?&nbsp; Strain not my patience
over much&mdash;&rsquo;tis a slender cord at best, and somewhat
tried already.&nbsp; Speak, is it yea or nay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius looked away to where Mary&rsquo;s flowers lay bruised
and scattered on the flag of blood-red marble; his answer came
low and clear:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is nay.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thrust her head forward, and looked at him wondering;
there was a stain where her teeth had been busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is nay,&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated after him,
and her eyes mocked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;May a poor Princess ask the
Signor&rsquo;s reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius pointed past her to the fallen lilies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lies there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the hot colour splashed the angry whiteness of
her cheek; then, pale to the lips, she turned on him; and she
stammered in her wrath:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And dost thou&mdash;dost thou dare, say this to my
face&mdash;to me, who stooped to ask when I had but to
command?&nbsp; I, with <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>my unmatched beauty; I, who hold the
hearts of men in thrall to the lifting of my eyes; I, to whom men
kneel as to their God!&nbsp; Art thou mad, mad, that thou canst
set aside such a behest as mine?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis small wonder
men say thy doublet hides a monkish dress; of a truth the tale
they brought savoured of little else.&nbsp; Hear me, thou
prating, milk-faced Modesty, I choose that thou shalt limn this
face of mine: say me nay, and I will teach thee a lesson hard of
forgetting; for I will silence thy preaching for aye, and lend my
serving-men to whip thee through the streets.&nbsp; Men, said
I?&nbsp; Nay, thou art too much a cur to make fit sport for men:
rather my maids shall wield the rod and lace thy
shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung herself on a low couch by the open window, where the
peacocks on the terrace strutted in the sun; and Hilarius waited,
dumb as the dog to which she had likened him, for he had no
word.</p>
<p>There was silence a while.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Then
the Princess spoke, and her voice cut Hilarius like the sting of
a lash:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me yon flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set them at my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent his knee and did so, wondering.</p>
<p>A moment, and she trod them under; their dying fragrance
filled the air, as their living breath had flooded the senses of
the blind-eyed lad at the Monastery gate.</p>
<p>One by one she set her heel upon the blossoms, and the marble
was yellow with stolen gold.</p>
<p>Hilarius held his breath; it was as if she did to death some
living thing, and yet he dared not bid her stay her insolent
feet.</p>
<p>It was done; and she looked at him under questioning
brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for thy lilies!&nbsp; Dost still think that it
will soil thy brush to limn such an one as I?&nbsp; I, whom men
call the Queen of Love&mdash;but thy lips, say they, burnt with
another name!&nbsp; Bethink thee, faint heart, there is not a man
in all this <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>city but would count death a small price to pay for my
favours; and I ask of thee one little service, and thou shalt
name thine own reward.&nbsp; Surely &rsquo;tis churlish to
gainsay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was suddenly sweet.</p>
<p>Stooping, she gathered to her the destruction she had wrought,
fingering the fallen petals tenderly, with a little sigh.&nbsp;
She glanced up at Hilarius through her lashes&rsquo; net.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe I was over hasty,&rdquo; she said softly, and a sob
swelled the round of her wonderful throat&mdash;&ldquo;and yet
how couldst thou call me wanton?&rdquo;&nbsp; Her mouth drooped a
little&mdash;she was very fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art thou still minded to set these poor pale flowers
against the roses in love&rsquo;s garden?&nbsp; For I love
thee,&rdquo; she added, and then suddenly she was still.</p>
<p>Hilarius looked from the dead flowers to the woman in her
over-mastering beauty, and all at once the passion that lies hid
in the heart of every man leapt to his lips.&nbsp; He desired
this woman as he had never before desired aught in all the world,
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>and he
knew, to his shame, that she was his for the asking.&nbsp; The
blood thudded and rang in his veins; he feasted his eyes on the
curve of her neck and the radiance of her sun-swept hair.&nbsp;
He stretched out his hands, but ere he could speak she raised a
white, terrified face, and glanced over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who touched me?&rdquo; she gasped, her voice shrill
with fear, &ldquo;who touched me?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she sprang to
her feet.</p>
<p>There was no one: the two shared a common pallor as they
stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes across the dying
lilies.&nbsp; Hilarius shrank back and covered his face with his
hands.&nbsp; Clear and distinct he heard the Prior&rsquo;s voice:
&ldquo;<i>A light woman&mdash;a light woman</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said hoarsely, &ldquo;Go, go;&rdquo; and
without word or look Hilarius went.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Prior rose from his knees comforted.&nbsp; He had wrestled
with the devil for his son&rsquo;s soul, and knew that he had
prevailed.</p>

133</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OPEN EYES AT THE GATE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> year wrote its record on
forest and field.&nbsp; The weeks passed; summer sped to autumn,
the ripe corn bowed to the sickle.&nbsp; The Convent&rsquo;s
lands were rich and heavy, virgin soil reclaimed; and the Prior,
watching the last great wain piled high with wealth of golden
treasure, saw the porter coming to him.</p>
<p>Now the porter was stout, short of breath, and of a hasty
spirit; and the Prior knew something was amiss by reason of his
hurried gait and wrathful countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Domine,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Domine, there is a
ragged man at the gate, a vagabond by his own showing, and he
craves speech of thee.&nbsp; I bade him go to the guest-house,
but he will not budge, and hath waited already an hour despite
my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter stayed, staring; he spoke <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>to the
wind; the Prior was already halfway to the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This my son was dead and is alive again,&rdquo; sang
his heart.&nbsp; The porter, afraid, hasted after him with the
keys, and had scarce time to do his office ere the sunburnt
vagabond was clasped in the Prior&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; It was a
harvesting indeed.</p>
<p>That night Hilarius went across to the Prior&rsquo;s house to
tell the tale of his journeyings.&nbsp; He found him seated in a
great oak chair by the open window; the sky was ablaze with
stars, and the flame of the oil lamp jarred like a splash of
yellow paint on the moonlight which flooded the room; the
Prior&rsquo;s eyes smiled measureless content, and the murmured
&ldquo;<i>Laus Deo</i>&rdquo; of his lips voiced the gladness of
his heart.&nbsp; Thus, in the shelter of peace and a great love,
Hilarius told his tale, while the forest waved a welcome to him
over the Monastery wall, and the late lilies burned white in the
garth below.</p>
<p>The Prior sat with his chin in his hand, his eyes fixed on the
lad&rsquo;s face, pale against <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>the dark wainscot; and Hilarius told
of his journeyings, and all that befell, even as it hath been
recorded in this chronicle; and the Prior&rsquo;s eyes were wet
as he heard of the little maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, my son?&rdquo; said the Prior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my Father, I companied with the caravan folk as
far as the sea-coast; and, leaving them there, went overseas in
the train of my lord Bishop Robert Walter of Norwich, who was
hasting to Rome.&nbsp; He knew thee, my Father, and bade his
people supply my needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, he knows me,&rdquo; said the Prior briefly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord reward him according to his works, but show him
mercy forasmuch as he had compassion on my son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then saw I Rome, my Father, that great and beauteous
city full of treasure and many wonders; only the Holy Father I
did not see, being let.&nbsp; Methinks life in that country is as
one long pageant; but I marked that great holiness and an evil
life, much riches and much penury, dwelt there side by side, and
men reeked little <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>of death but much of pleasure.&nbsp; Then one bade me
go to Florence an I would be a limner; therefore I hasted
thither, and gave my last coin for bread as I entered the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior&rsquo;s brows contracted; the lad had seen some
schooling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thou didst learn to be a limner, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, my Father, in God&rsquo;s time: at first I must
herd goats and sell melons in the market-place for a lump of
bread.&nbsp; Day by day I strove to gain enough to buy colours,
but could not, for the Lord sent me ever a neighbour poorer than
myself.&nbsp; Nevertheless I was of good courage, knowing the
Lord&rsquo;s ways are not as ours; and mindful how Brother
Ambrose held that inasmuch as the Heavenly City is laid with fair
colours &rsquo;twere no sin to deem that a man may limn perfect
pictures there, for the gift is from the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, &rsquo;tis a great lesson thou hast
learnt,&rdquo; said the Prior, &ldquo;for the Word was made
Flesh; and as Blessed John hath it, <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>a man cannot love God unseen, if he
love not the brother whom He hath given him.&nbsp; What next,
dear lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Father, the Lord Himself sent a messenger to
me.&nbsp; One day a great limner, the Signor Andrea di Cione,
whom men call d&rsquo;Orcagna, stayed by me where I stood with my
melons in the shadow of the Shepherd&rsquo;s Tower, and bade me
follow him to his house, for he would fain use me for an
angel&rsquo;s head in the great Altar-piece he was e&rsquo;en
then concerned with for the Church of the White Friars.&nbsp;
Later he heard my story; and when he found I had some small skill
with the brush, he kept me with him, and taught me as only such
an one can teach: him I served five years.&nbsp; And many times
Satan desired my soul; nay, once I was in peril of hell-fire, but
the Lord was with me, and plucked my feet out of the pit.&nbsp;
But of that I will speak anon, at my shriving, as is
meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior remembered his dream, but he said no word, and
Hilarius took up his tale.</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>&ldquo;Then one day my master cried there was an end to
teaching; nevertheless he would have me bide with him in honour
for the work.&nbsp; But my heart was full of longing for home and
the scent of the forest; and, above all, for thee, my Father;
therefore I set my face north, that I might bring back my gift to
St Benedict and our Church; and should have been here long ere
this, but I was let by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior looked up a little anxiously, and Hilarius smiled at
the question in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a lawless tract, my Father, under the shadow
of the great mountains beyond Florence; and I was taken by
robbers, who bore me and others of our company to their fastness
in the hills: there I lay in a little cave many days; but what
befell the rest I know not.&nbsp; The robbers brought me forth to
serve them, and by God&rsquo;s mercy handled me kindly, though
they thought little of bloodshedding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of them was troubled in his <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>spirit, and
minded to forsake this evil manner of life.&nbsp; Therefore one
night he fled, carrying me with him, when the others had gone
forth; and we made good our way to Mantua.&nbsp; There Pietro,
for so was the robber called, left me that he might give himself
to the service of God and men, inasmuch as he had formerly abused
them.&nbsp; Never saw I man so changed, my Father; his speech,
formerly profane, was all of God and the Saints; he did penance
and confessed his sins publicly; ay, by the Justice&rsquo;s order
he received one hundred lashes in the market-place, and at every
lash he cried with upturned face, &lsquo;<i>Deo
Gratias</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; And I was there, because he besought of
me to stand in the crowd and pray for him that his courage failed
not.&nbsp; But it came to pass that even the people marvelled at
his joyful endurance; and indeed &rsquo;twas more like a
scourging of one of the blessed martyrs than of a poor sinful
robber.&nbsp; After this the Brothers of the Poor took him, for
such was his desire; and so I bade him farewell, and craved his
blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;The Lord fulfil all his mind!&rdquo; said the
Prior with clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Hilarius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didst thou not fear to journey further alone, my
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my Father, I found for the most part good and
kindly men by the way, despite their somewhat evil seeming; but
at Genoa I took service with a merchant then beginning his
journey, and travelled with him through Flanders, a strange, flat
country with many canals and tall poplar trees; and so we came to
Bruges in safety, after a most prosperous course.&nbsp; There he
commended me to a good friend of his, a wool merchant travelling
to Salisbury; and at first all things went well with us; but
later the winds proved contrary, and we were driven hither and
thither in great peril of our lives, but at last made the Bristol
Channel, and so came safe into port.&nbsp; Thence I have come
hither afoot begging my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hilarius had made an end, the Prior took him in his arms
and blessed him <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>for his dear son; praising God that the lad had come
back a child at heart, but hungering, loving, open-eyed.</p>
<p>Next morning, being shriven, Hilarius ate the bread and drank
the wine of the &ldquo;wayfaring man,&rdquo; his heart merry for
the joy of his home-coming.&nbsp; When the Lady-Mass was ended he
knelt on in her Chapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Light of Love, all praise and thanks be thine
from thy poor son,&rdquo; sang his heart; and then he prayed for
his little maid.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PASSING OF PRIOR STEPHEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Convent welcomed Hilarius
gladly, and on the Feast of St Michael he made his profession,
for the Prior deemed that he had served his noviciate and been
found faithful; and the Brethren assented eagerly, for they <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>were fain
to keep this wondrous limner for the service of their own
Church.</p>
<p>Then, by the Prior&rsquo;s command, Hilarius set himself to
limn a great picture for the High Altar.&nbsp; It was a
Crucifixion, and all his heart and all his love were in it.&nbsp;
When the Brethren first saw the fair proportion and fine colours
that Hilarius brought to the work, they rejoiced in that their
Church should be glorified above other Churches of the Order; but
when the picture was near completing, and they gazed up into the
wondrous face of the Great King who looked down from the throne
of His triumphant suffering, with a world of hunger and love in
His eyes for those who had so enthroned Him, they hung their
heads for shame because of the emulation in their hearts; and lo!
the Cellarer, for very love, was careful for the needs of the
elder Brethren; and the monks, for very love, laid hold gladly of
suffering, and so the Convent was blessed, and lived together in
unity.</p>
<p>In one of the groups very near the Cross, Hilarius set a
grey-eyed girl, a woman with <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>a babe at the breast, and clinging
to her skirts, a little flaxen-headed maid.&nbsp; None but the
Prior knew the meaning of these three, and their names, with that
of a poor light-o&rsquo;-love, were ever on his lips when he
offered the Holy Sacrifice.</p>
<p>Gentle Brother Hilarius painted and loved, and was beloved of
all his world.&nbsp; The years sped, and he became in turn
Almoner, Novice-master, and Sub-Prior: and no man envied him, for
he reckoned himself ever as least of all and servant of all.</p>
<p>Prior Stephen attained his fourscore years, ruling the Convent
wisely and well to the very end: ay, and never ailed aught, his
call coming as it might be straight from the mouth of the
Lord.</p>
<p>On the Feast of Blessed Stephen he went into the chapter and
said as always: &ldquo;<i>The souls of the deceased brethren and
believers rest in peace</i>!&rdquo; to which the Convent replied,
&ldquo;<i>Amen</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then with his hands raised to
bless he cried, &ldquo;<i>Benedicite</i>,&rdquo; and again with
loud and joyful voice &ldquo;<i>Domine</i>,&rdquo; and again,
&ldquo;<i>Domine</i>!&rdquo; as of one who answers to his <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>name&mdash;and so passed to his place in the Kingdom of
Christ.</p>
<p>The Convent elected Hilarius to be Prior in his stead, which
election the Abbat of Cluny confirmed with good grace.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the fame of the Monastery grew because of the
exceeding beauty of the Church, for Hilarius, with those whom he
taught, set fair pictures on the walls, and blazoned the roof
with the blue of heaven and gold of the wakeful stars.&nbsp; In
the span over the High Altar he set Blessed Benedict himself with
the face of Prior Stephen, and round him the angel virtues; even
as one Giotto, a shepherd lad, had limned them in the Church of
the Little Brothers.</p>
<p>Now Prior Hilarius desired greatly to set a picture of Our
Lady above the Altar in her Chapel.&nbsp; Long did he pray with
ever-increasing fervour and much fasting that this boon might be
vouchsafed him for her glory and the Convent&rsquo;s greater
good.&nbsp; And one day&mdash;&rsquo;twas her Nativity&mdash;he
set his hand to the work, for it seemed to him that she <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>would have
it so; and he was greatly humbled that such heavenly kindness
should attend so vile a sinner.&nbsp; Day by day he set apart
some hours for this service; and he limned a face so fair and
radiant, with woman&rsquo;s love and light of heaven, that it was
whispered in the cloister walks that the Prior had surely been
blessed by a vision, else had he never pictured the Maid-Mother
in so wondrous a fashion: and of a truth a man might well give
credence to such a story, for the joy that shone in the
Prior&rsquo;s eyes and might not be hid.</p>
<p>Many other tales did the Brethren tell of Hilarius, but
softly, for he would hear no word of his own deeds or the favours
vouchsafed him.</p>
<p>When he walked in the garth the pigeons circled round him
crooning their peace-note; and it was told that the kine in the
meadows ceased browsing when he passed, and needs must company
with him a little way.</p>
<p>Once it befell that a lay-brother was afflicted with heavy
sickness by reason of <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the sun&rsquo;s great heat; and
Satan strove with him for his undoing, so that the poor soul
foamed at the mouth and roared out blasphemy; yea, verily, and
must be held with cords also, lest he do himself or his fellows
some grievous hurt.&nbsp; But when the Prior laid his hand
between the man&rsquo;s troubled eyes sweet sleep came upon him,
and his madness forsook him.</p>
<p>The poor also crowded to the Monastery gate and were fed, ay,
even if the Brethren went hungry; and if any man in all the
villages round had aught against his neighbour he would come to
the Prior for a just hearing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite these things the Convent&rsquo;s peace
began to be troubled.&nbsp; Men sought the Monastery for its
famous name, caring but little for religion; there were many
young novices within its walls, and the strong hand of Prior
Stephen was lacking.&nbsp; Hilarius was of gentler build; he
would speak ever in love, thinking no evil, whereas it is not
given to all men to understand that tongue.&nbsp; So it came to
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>pass
that the younger Brethren waxed fat and kicked, and the elder
Brethren murmured.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;GABRIEL, MAKE THIS MAN TO
UNDERSTAND THE VISION.&rdquo;&mdash;DAN. viii. 16.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day the Novice-master, Brother
Adam, a most worthy man, came in sore trouble to the Prior and
would resign his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely never before did such an ill-conditioned brood
find shelter in a monastery!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
grow fat, idle, insolent, quarrelsome-never at peace among
themselves; never a Pater or an Ave too many, or a task
fulfilled, save for fear of stripes.&nbsp; I would that the time
of blood-letting were here that their high stomachs might be
brought low.&nbsp; I am no longer young, my Father, and this
burden tries me sorely.&nbsp; Prithee, let it be shifted to
another and a stronger back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>The
Prior listened with many an inward <i>mea culpa</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a sad hearing, Brother Adam, but young blood is
hard of mastering; maybe this ill mood will pass.&nbsp; The lad
Robert is surely ever gentle and decorous?&nbsp; He hath a most
beauteous voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Novice-master threw up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Father, nay, he hath indeed the voice of an angel,
but methinks his body is surely the habitation of Satan.&nbsp; He
will sing an it please him&mdash;or when thou art by, my
Father,&mdash;but, an it please him not, he is silent; ay, even
under grievous stripes.&nbsp; The Precentor giveth him as
negligent and ill-conditioned; and in choir, when he looketh most
like to one of God&rsquo;s Saints, he is but plotting mischief
for the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior heard him sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hubert?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hubert
methinks hath a great love of colour and a fine hand with the
brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Adam was almost speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hubert!&nbsp; Nay Father, forgive me, Father, but even
this very Hubert but yesterday slipped a handful of pebbles into
Brother <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Edmund&rsquo;s mess, whereby he was like to break his
teeth or take some more grievous hurt.&nbsp; And indeed the peace
of the Brethren is much troubled, wherefore they complain
bitterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young blood, young blood, but not of necessity
evil,&rdquo; said the Prior.&nbsp; Then, seeing the
Novice-master&rsquo;s aggrieved face, he bade him have patience
yet a little, for he himself would speak to the novices; and with
this Brother Adam must fain be content.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The next day in the Chapter the Prior spoke.</p>
<p>It comes to pass oftentimes that men seeing a sign are made
curious by it; and then forgetting, find the clue thereto, it may
be, long after.&nbsp; Even thus it happened on this day in the
Chapter; and when Prior Hilarius was gathered to his rest the
Brethren remembered how they had marked and marvelled at the
strange beauty of his face, the beauty as of one who sees the
face of the Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;for my
children <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>ye are, though I see among you many it were more
fitting I should hail as father, but that the ruling of the Lord
cannot be gainsaid&mdash;my children, I am minded to think that I
have this day a message on my lips that is not mine own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night a vision came to me as I slept.&nbsp;
Blessed Benedict, our Father, stood at my side, and his face was
troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arise, my son,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;arise,
for the Lord is at hand and hath need of thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, deeming it was of judgment that he spake, sprang
up in shame and fear that the Master should find me sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then cried Blessed Benedict again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If thou wilt serve the Lord, make haste, for He
hath called thee these many times,&rsquo; and so saying passed
from my sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, I went forth as one bewildered, and made
haste to the Church lest peradventure I should find Him; but the
lamps burnt dim and all was silent.&nbsp; Then I turned aside and
went out into the night, and it was very dark, with no sound but
the wind in the forest trees.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>&ldquo;My heart was a-hungered, and I sought in
cloister and garth; and as I hasted to the gate I cried aloud,
even as she cried who sought Him in a garden&mdash;&lsquo;They
have taken away my Lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the gate I stayed me, and besought the Lord for a
sign; and lo, in the darkness one came and led me by the hand
away from the gate, across the garth and up the dormitory stair,
nor loosed me until I passed within where the Brethren lay
sleeping, and the chamber was bright with exceeding radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found myself by the pallet of my dear son Robert: his
face was wet with tears; and as he lay I saw upon his shoulder
the mark of many stripes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, one took my hand and led me from one to another
of our Brethren, and on every face lay the shadow of a great
need, but in every face there was somewhat of the Christ; and the
lesson burnt in my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then One came swiftly and laid healing hands on the boy
Robert; but I fled, for <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>I might not see Him; and I awoke
sore troubled&mdash;ay, and the trouble is on me still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Brethren, I can but tell the vision as it came to
me.&nbsp; Great is the rule of Benedict, our Father, and in it
stripes, grievous and many as our sins, have their rightful
place; but mayhap we forget that love, and love alone, should
strike.&nbsp; Ay, and I mind me how Prior Stephen, my Father,
said that to be monk a man must learn before all things to hunger
and to love.&nbsp; Love should draw the water and build the fire,
till the field and attend the sanctuary; and hunger we should
cherish in our hearts, hunger for righteousness and for the souls
of our brethren, for this is the hunger of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men come over lightly to the Lord&rsquo;s work; and lo!
pride and emulation, jealousy and discontent, spring up and
thrive, and the end is shame and confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak as to my children; it is in my heart that the
Lord is at hand: let us see that we love while there is yet
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned to the novices and <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>stretched out his hands to where
they stood amazed, and it may be ashamed&mdash;not after this
manner was Brother Adam wont to rebuke them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ye, who are, as it were, the babes of our Order,
give heed to your ways, neither bring unwilling hands to this
service.&nbsp; Better far go forth, yea, even to death, than mock
the Lord with froward feet and a heart that is full of
vanity.&nbsp; Remember the sacrifice which Cain offered and the
Lord rejected, for he gainsayed the voice of the Lord and
disobeyed His Commandment; wherefore the wrath of God fell upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I who speak now, speak in love; give ear to my words,
and let fear befriend you; for the coming of the Lord is as a
thief in the night, and lo! stripes bitter and many await that
servant whom the Master finds sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prior, having made an end of speaking, raised his
hand to bless, and went forth in silence; and no man stirred in
his place, for they knew that the Lord had spoken and were
afraid.</p>
<h3><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HUNGER OF DICKON THE
WOODMAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">June</span> was at an end, and men cried
aloud for rain.&nbsp; The hedges were white, the fields scorched
and brown; the leaves fell from the trees as at autumn&rsquo;s
touch; the fruits scarce formed hung wry and twisted on the
bough; the heavens burnt pitiless, without a cloud.</p>
<p>Dickon, the woodman, sat by the wayside gnawing a crust and a
scrap of mouldy bacon.&nbsp; There was no sound but the howl of a
dog from some neighbouring farmstead, and he sat in sullen mood,
his bill-hook beside him, brooding over his wrongs; for the world
had gone contrary with him.</p>
<p>His wife was dead; she had died in childbed a month gone,
leaving six hungry, naked brats on his shoulders; and now a worse
thing had befallen him; his gold was gone&mdash;his gold to which
he had no right, for &rsquo;twas blood-money, the food of <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>his
children, ay, and something beside; but Dickon loved that gold
piece above all the world&mdash;above Heaven and his own
soul&mdash;and it was gone.</p>
<p>A neighbour had surely done it; marked the hiding-place which
he had deemed so safe, and made off with the prize; and i&rsquo;
faith &rsquo;twas easy carrying.&nbsp; There was but one piece,
and Dickon minded how he had changed his petty hoard to gold
scarce a month back at the fair.&nbsp; Maybe it was Thomas the
charcoal burner had served him this ill turn; or William
Crookleg, the miller&rsquo;s man; he was a sly, prying fellow,
and there had been ill blood between them.</p>
<p>He was fain to seek the Monastery that lay the other side the
forest, and crave justice of the Prior, but that the Prior might
say &rsquo;twas ill-got gain and well rid of.</p>
<p>Dickon rose to his feet and shambled homewards; he was ragged,
ill-fed, unkempt.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s work was done, and on the
village green he found men and women, for the most part as
ill-clad as himself, <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>standing about in groups
gossiping.&nbsp; The innkeeper lounged at the ale-house door,
thin and peaked as his fellows; there was no good living for any
man in those parts, by reason of the over-lord who sore oppressed
them.</p>
<p>A little man, keen-eyed and restless, holding a lean and sorry
horse by the bridle, was talking eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, &rsquo;tis true eno&rsquo;, and three crows saw I
this very day on the churchyard wall&mdash;it bodes ill to some
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the innkeeper, &ldquo;have it
thine own way.&nbsp; Methinks the ill hath outrun the omen, for
there will be naught for man or beast shortly&mdash;but fine
pickings for thy three crows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man scowled at him: Dickon came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to do?&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said mine host, &ldquo;Robin will have it
that some further evil is upon us&mdash;tho&rsquo; methinks we
have got our fill and to spare with this drought&mdash;ay, and
&rsquo;twas at thy house, Dickon, he saw the
corpse-light.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&ldquo;Better a corpse-light than six open mouths, and
naught to fill them,&rdquo; said Dickon surlily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whither away, Robin?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not far this beast
will travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right thou art, but my master will turn an honest penny
with the carcass,&rdquo; answered the little man; &ldquo;give me
my reckoning, friend John.&nbsp; I must needs haste if I would
see the Forester&rsquo;s ere nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out a few small coins and a gold piece.&nbsp; When
Dickon saw it his eyes gleamed.&nbsp; Robin paid the reckoning
and put the piece in his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard-earned money&mdash;&rsquo;tis blood out of a stone
to draw wages from my master.&nbsp; Better it should light in my
belly than in a rogue&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as well
for me that John o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Swift-foot swings at the
cross-roads.&nbsp; Godden, my masters!&rdquo;&nbsp; And leading
his weary beast, he took the road that skirted the forest.</p>
<p>The moon was at full, and he had yet a good stretch of lonely
way before him, when the horse stumbled and fell and would not
rise.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;A murrain on the beast!&rdquo; muttered Robin
angrily, tugging in vain at the creature on whom death had taken
pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must e&rsquo;en leave him by the wayside and
tell Richard what hath befallen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped to loose the halter, and as he bent to his task a
man slipped from the shadow of the hedge into the quiet
moonlight.&nbsp; There was a thud, a dull cry, and Robin fell
prone across the horse&rsquo;s neck&mdash;a pace beyond him in
the moonlight shone the gleam of gold.</p>
<p>Next day Dickon&rsquo;s child died, ay, and the other five
followed with scant time between the buryings.&nbsp; Another had
fathered them and filled the gaping mouths; but men shuddered at
his care, for it was the Black Death that they had deemed far
from them.</p>
<p>Pale and woebegone they clustered on the green.&nbsp; News had
come of Robin&mdash;he was dead when they found him&mdash;but no
man gave heed.&nbsp; Death was in the air, death held them safe
in walls they might not scale.&nbsp; The heavens were brass, food
<a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>failed
for man and beast, God and man alike had forsaken them.&nbsp; The
forest lay one side, the river, now but a shallow sluggish
stream, lay the other; &rsquo;twas a cleft stick and the springe
tightened.</p>
<p>No evil had as yet befallen Dickon.&nbsp; He stood with the
rest and murmured, cursing.&nbsp; All at once he made for the
ale-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools that we are to stand like helpless brats when
there is liquor enough and to spare in yon cellars.&nbsp; He who
is minded to go dry throat to Heaven had best make haste; for me
I will e&rsquo;en swill a bucket to the devil&rsquo;s health, and
so to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-a-dozen men followed him, pushing aside mine host who
strove to bar the door.&nbsp; Some of the women fell on their
knees and clamoured in half delirious prayer; the rest slunk
dismayed to their pestilent homes.</p>
<h3><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VISION OF THE EVENING AND THE
MORNING</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, news came to the
Monastery of the ill case of the village, for it lay scarce a
league away across the forest; but the pine-trees stood as
guardian angels in between.</p>
<p>The Prior summoned the whole Convent, according to the ruling
of Blessed Benedict when the matter is a grave one, and told the
tidings.</p>
<p>Then he went on to give reason for their assembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Brethren, it is in my heart that we dare not leave
these poor, stricken sheep to die alone without shepherding;
moreover, in their fear and desolation, they may flee to other
villages, and so the terror and pest spread ever further.&nbsp;
And I deem that, inasmuch as Charity is greater than Faith or
Hope, so it is greater than <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>obedience also.&nbsp; Wherefore I
purpose to set aside the Rule of our Order in the letter that I
may hold to it in the spirit, and go forth to serve these
perishing brethren; and I will take with me whosoever hears the
call of God in this visitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had made an end, there was silence in the
Chapter.&nbsp; Break cloister, the Prior himself urging them
thereto?&nbsp; The Convent might scarce credit its ears.</p>
<p>Prior Hilarius watched his children with a tender smile on his
white face, and a prayer on his lips that love might have its
triumph.</p>
<p>Five monks stood up, among them the Sub-Prior, and seven
novices sprang also to their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Brother Walter,&rdquo; said Hilarius, turning to
the Sub-Prior, &ldquo;this flock must have its shepherd also; thy
place is here.&nbsp; But I will take with me Brother Simon and
Brother Leo, who will doubtless suffice at first for the
ministry, and&mdash;&rdquo; smiling at the
novices&mdash;&ldquo;all these dear lads to tend the sick and
bury the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>The
Sub-Prior ventured on a remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Father, it is not fitting that thou
should&rsquo;st go on such an errand; send me in thy stead, for
my life is a small thing as compared with thine.&nbsp; Moreover
these novices, &rsquo;tis but the other day the Master gave them
as lazy and ill-conditioned, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Brother, I thank thee for thy love and care for
me; but my call has come.&nbsp; As for these&mdash;&rdquo; he
stretched out his hand towards the waiting
novices&mdash;&ldquo;maybe they are in the wrong school, and the
Lord hath even opened the door that they may serve Him, perchance
die for Him, elsewhere.&nbsp; And shall I count myself wiser than
Prior Stephen, who set me without the gate to learn my
lesson?&nbsp; Let us go in peace, my children, for we are about
the Lord&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Very early next day, having eaten of Heavenly manna, the
little band embraced <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>their brethren and set out, laden
with food and wine and herbs from the farmery; and the Prior
appointed a place to which the Convent should send daily all
things needed.</p>
<p>The shade of the forest was very welcome in the hot,
breathless sunshine, and the scent of the pine-needles, odorous,
pungent, rose at each footfall from the silent path.&nbsp; The
Brethren chanted the Gradual Psalms as they paced two and two
through the sun-lit aisles, full of the Prior&rsquo;s memories;
and he looked up again to see Our Lady&rsquo;s robe across the
tree-tops.&nbsp; Then all at once the Psalm broke, and Brother
Simon, who was leading, stayed suddenly.</p>
<p>Under a bush beside the track lay a man, naked save for filthy
rags; his hair and beard matted with moss and leaves; his eyes
sunk, his lips drawn apart in a ghastly grin.&nbsp; Hilarius made
haste to kneel beside him, and lo! sudden remembrance lighted the
fast-glazing eyes, but his own answered not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, my son,&rdquo; said the Prior, and <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>his voice
was very pitiful, &ldquo;thou art indeed in evil case; let me
shrive thee ere it be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned the others to stand back, and raising the heavy
head upon his shoulder, bent close to catch the whisper of the
parched lips.</p>
<p>At first no sound came, and then a hoarse word reached
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Convent&rsquo;s hens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prior stared amazed; then once more the laboured
voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast forgot thy theft, and the dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarius needed no further word; in a moment the years were
wiped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lad, lad, to find thee again, and in such sorry
plight!&nbsp; But see, stay not thy shriving, for the time is
short, and the Lord ever ready to pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man strove in vain to speak.&nbsp; At last he said quite
clearly: &ldquo;I hunger,&rdquo; and so saying died.</p>
<p>The Prior was greatly moved, and for a while he knelt in
prayer, while the Brethren, amazed, waited his pleasure.&nbsp;
Then he rose, <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>and lo! before him lay the open glade where his
schooling had begun, and he had seen a flower incarnate dance in
the wind.</p>
<p>He bade them lift the dead, and lay him in the hollow of the
glade under fallen branches until they could return and give him
burial.&nbsp; Then, as they went on their way, he told the tale
of his little maid; and when the telling was ended, the village
they had come to succour was in sight, and lo! they saw it
through a mist.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;BEHOLD THE FIELDS ARE
WHITE&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prior&rsquo;s heart was ready,
and it seemed to him as he passed up the village and saw the
huddled, helpless people, that his little maid led him by the
hand.</p>
<p>Brother Simon, Brother Leo, and the novices turned aside to
speak comfort and carry succour to the sick and fearful, <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and to bury
the dead; for three unshriven souls had passed to judgment and
mercy.&nbsp; Hilarius made straight for the ale-house.</p>
<p>As he crossed the green, the door opened and Dickon stumbled
blindly down the steps.&nbsp; At sight of a monk he cried out,
and suddenly sobered, dropped on his knees, while the topers and
roysterers staring from the open doorway fell into silence.</p>
<p>Hilarius pushed back his cowl and stood bareheaded in the
scorching sun of that windless day; it came to his mind that he
was very weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, O my children, the Lord hath sent me to succour
you, lest ye go down quick into the pit.&nbsp; Return, every one
of you, for the arms of His love are still stretched wide upon
the Rood, and the very hairs of your head are numbered.&nbsp;
Repent ye, therefore, and confess each one of you his sins, that
I may prepare him for the work of the Lord; and take comfort
also, for they that are with us are mighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one the men, sobered by the shock of great surprise,
confessed and were <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>shriven under the summer sun: only the man Dickon was
not among them.&nbsp; Then the Prior bade them get to work as he
should direct; and he set a watch that no man should flee the
village; and all obeyed him.</p>
<p>Early and late the Prior toiled with the Brethren and his band
of workers, nursing the sick, burying the dead, and destroying
the pestilent dwellings.</p>
<p>Brother Leo was the first to whom the call came: he answered
it like a soldier at his post.</p>
<p>As the Prior rose from the pallet of his dead son, one bade
him come quickly, for a dying man had need of him.&nbsp; It was
Dickon.</p>
<p>The Prior, bearing with him the Body of the Lord, made haste
to the hovel where he lay, and shrived him though he scarce could
hear his muttered words; but lo! when he would place the Host he
could not, for a gold piece lay on the man&rsquo;s tongue.&nbsp;
The Prior drew back dismayed, and behold, the Lord&rsquo;s hand
struck swiftly, and Dickon <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>died with a barren shriving&mdash;on
whom may Christ take pity!</p>
<p>Next day great grey clouds curtained the arid, staring sky;
and at even came the rain.&nbsp; All through the night it fell;
and one of the novices, who lay a-dying in the Prioir&rsquo;s
arms, heard it as he passed, and fell back, joy on his lips and a
radiant smile on his young face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Esurientes implevit bonis</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo;
said the Prior, as he laid him down, blessing God.</p>
<p>A second novice died, then a third, and yet another; but there
was no need to call further help from the Monastery, for the
Plague was stayed.&nbsp; Never had cloistered monks spent such a
strange season; rarely such a blessed one.</p>
<p>The Feast of the Transfiguration was nigh at hand, and the
Prior was minded to return on that day to the waiting, anxious
Convent, for his work was done.</p>
<p>Great was the joy and preparation at the Monastery when the
tidings reached them; joy too for those who lay not in the
shelter of the cloister garth, but, as it were, on the <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>battlefield
where they had given their lives for their brethren.</p>
<p>The holy day dawned without a cloud.&nbsp; A strong west wind
bowed the pines in the forest, and they worshipped and sang for
joy, because of the face of the Lord.&nbsp; The sun burnt bright
in the great blue dome, and earth shone with pale reflection of
his glory.</p>
<p>The monks paced the cloister walks, and waited and watched to
catch the signal from the lay-brother posted without.&nbsp; At
last the word came that voices were heard in the distance; and
monks and novices hastened two and two to the gate.&nbsp; On the
wind was borne the sound of a chant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a dirge for those that are gone,&rdquo; said
Brother Anselm; and crossing themselves, the Brothers chanted out
the sonorous response:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Et lux
perpetua luceat eis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they reached the open gate, the little band they waited for
came slowly down the forest pathway.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Four
Brothers, only four; and lo! on their shoulders they bore a rude
bier of pine-branches.</p>
<p>This was the gathering of Brother Hilarius.&nbsp;
Sweet-scented boughs for his last bed; Mary&rsquo;s lilies aglow
for tapers tall; the censer of the forest swung by sun and wind;
and the glory of the face of the Lord.</p>
<p>He had called his children to him in the late night-watches,
and having kissed and blessed them, he bade them turn him to the
east, for his time had come; and they obeyed in sore grief and
perplexed.&nbsp; Prior Hilarius lay and watched for the light,
and as dawn parted night&rsquo;s veil with the long foregleam of
the coming day, he shut his eyes like a tired child and went
home.</p>
<p>It was his heart, Brother Simon thought; but the Sub-Prior
cried through his tears:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, it was God a-hungered for His dear
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They bore the Prior into the white-clad Church, and laid him
on his forest-bed <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>under the great Christ; and the novices, seeing the
tender smile on the beautiful face, whispered one to another,
&ldquo;The Prior hath found his little maid.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
Convent made Hilarius a wondrous fair tomb of alabaster inlaid
with gold, and carved him lying thereon with Mary&rsquo;s lilies
across his breast.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
